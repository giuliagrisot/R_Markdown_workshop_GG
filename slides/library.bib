  abstract = {In the last decade there has been a proliferation of research on misinformation. One important aspect of this work that receives less attention than it should is exactly why misinformation is a problem. To adequately address this question, we must first look to its speculated causes and effects. We examined different disciplines (computer science, economics, history, information science, journalism, law, media, politics, philosophy, psychology, sociology) that investigate misinformation. The consensus view points to advancements in information technology (e.g., the Internet, social media) as a main cause of the proliferation and increasing impact of misinformation, with a variety of illustrations of the effects. We critically analyzed both issues. As to the effects, misbehaviors are not yet reliably demonstrated empirically to be the outcome of misinformation; correlation as causation may have a hand in that perception. As to the cause, advancements in information technologies enable, as well as reveal, multitudes of interactions that represent significant deviations from ground truths through people's new way of knowing (intersubjectivity). This, we argue, is illusionary when understood in light of historical epistemology. Both doubts we raise are used to consider the cost to established norms of liberal democracy that come from efforts to target the problem of misinformation.}

The second phase begins in the 1640s, when writers attached to the Stuart court in exile came under the influence of French neo-classicism and writers who remained in England were released from the hegemony of court style and the restrictions of royal censorship. The chapter looks at the terms of the compromise as they affect two key areas of neo-classical poetic practice, poetic diction and versification, corresponding to those aspects of the sublime that Addison in labels 'the magnificence of the words' and 'the harmonious and lively turn of the phrase'.},

This chapter discusses the story of the two revolutions in terms of the style-markers and changing stylistic ideals which underlie the drift to orality quantified by Biber \& Fkiegan. The discussion covers changes in language-variety, versification, syntax and metaphor, in each case showing how Romantics and Modernists in turn distanced themselves from the stylistic practices of their predecessors. The chapter also offers an account of some special techniques that have developed in the literature of our period from the initial Romantic enterprise of representing a speaking voice in a printed text.}

  abstract = {From global search engines to local smart cities, from public health monitoring to personal self-tracking technologies, digital technologies continuously capture, process, and archive social, material, and affective information in the form of big data. Although the use of big data emerged from the human desire to acquire more knowledge and master more information and to eliminate human error in large-scale information management, it has become clear in recent years that big data technologies, and the archives of data they accrue, bring with them new and important uncertainties in the form of new biases, systemic errors, and, as a result, new ethical challenges that require urgent attention and analysis. This collaboratively written article outlines the conceptual framework of the Uncertain Archives research collective to show how cultural theories of the archive can be meaningfully applied to the empirical field of big data. More specifically, the article argues that this approach grounded in cultural theory can help research going forward to attune to and address the uncertainties present in the storage and analysis of large amounts of information. By focusing on the notions of the unknown, error, and vulnerability, we reveal a set of different, albeit intertwined, configurations of archival uncertainty that emerge along with the phenomenon of big data use. We regard these configurations as central to understanding the conditions of the digitally networked data archives that are a crucial component of today's cultures of surveillance and governmentality.},

This Element contends that networks are a category of study that cuts across traditional academic barriers, uniting diverse disciplines through a shared understanding of complexity in our world.

The world's first industrial revolution in Britain resulted in an explosion in the creation and collection of documentary sources. This book harnesses the combined power of massive digitised historical collections -- from maps and census returns to newspapers -- and computational analytical tools to examine the ways in which technology altered the very fabric of human existence on a hitherto unprecedented scale.  Collaboratively written, and developed through open community review, the book features an innovative open access edition enhanced with interactive maps, datasets and visualisations, digital notebooks, and multimedia content including video, audio and images. Its experimental approach uses easily reproducible methods based on open source code and linked to publicly available datasets.  Historians will find in this book a wealth of accessible material illuminating the human, social and cultural consequences of this historical moment. For digital humanists, cultural heritage professionals, librarians and archivists it is a rich example of the potential and methods of making collections available for digital scholarship. At once an exploration of the extraordinary impact of technology on humanity in the age of industry and a powerful digital artefact itself, this book is an essential text at the cutting edge of digital history.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence has started to expand in journalism, especially in advanced news organisations. It is evident that journalists are beginning to realise the importance of AI and that it will be a partner to human journalists in their work inside newsrooms. Despite the numerous benefits that AI contributes to journalism, several challenges hinder the expansion and spread of its adoption among journalists. The ethical challenges of AI systems have become a concern among journalists. Therefore, this research is guided by the relationship between technological development and media ethics as the philosophical study of morality, specifically the Social Responsibility Theory. This study adopts a qualitative approach to explore the ethical challenges of AI faced by journalists. In-depth interviews were conducted with 14 journalists working in the newsroom of a government-affiliated channel, Al Mamlaka TV in Jordan. Data obtained from interviews conducted were analysed thematically. The results concluded that the main ethical challenges faced by journalists in the newsroom in adopting AI are data bias; privacy violations; and the absence of legislation and international regulations regarding the use of AI in journalism. The study concludes that journalists at Al Mamlaka TV adhere to the basics of Social Responsibility Theory through their critical adoption of AI in the newsroom.}

This book brings together a distinguished group of international critics, scholars, and historians that includes several of the world's leading narrative theorists. Together, they survey many basic areas of narrative studies from an unnatural perspective: story, time, space, voice, minds, narrative levels, realism, nonfiction, hyperfiction, and narrative poetry. Rarely have these fundamental concepts been subjected to such an original and thoroughgoing reconceptualization. Much of the book is directed toward an investigation of experimental and antirealist work. Each essay focuses on texts and episodes that narrative theory has tended to neglect, and each provides theoretical formulations that are commensurate with such exceptional, albeit neglected, works. This book articulates and delineates the newest and most radical movement in narrative studies},

However, most of the previous studies in the field have focused on the categorization of emotions and on how these are present in texts. This approach fails if we want to understand the mechanisms that underpin the relevance of emotions in political discourse, because emotion categories do not tell us much about how and why an emotion is constructed as such. The purpose of this article is to propose a new framework for a more comprehensive analysis drawing upon previous studies on emotions from sociocognitive and constructivist perspectives. Taking into account that emotions are constructed by the addressee -and not by the speaker or the discourse itself-, I present a methodological approach that includes all the elements in play when an emotion arises. Example analysis of hate speech messages are provided to show the contributions that can be made to discourse analysis using this method.},

Little is known, however, of how common such experiences are, nor the individual differences they may reflect. Here we present the results of a 2014 survey conducted in collaboration with a national UK newspaper and an international book festival. Participants (n = 1566) completed measures of reading imagery, inner speech, and hallucination-proneness, including 413 participants who provided detailed free-text descriptions of their reading experiences. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that reading imagery was related to phenomenological characteristics of inner speech and proneness to hallucination-like experiences. However, qualitative analysis of reader's accounts suggested that vivid reading experiences were marked not just by auditory phenomenology, but also their tendency to cross over into non-reading contexts. This supports social-cognitive accounts of reading while highlighting a role for involuntary and uncontrolled personality models in the experience of fictional characters.}

  abstract = {Stories transport readers into vivid imaginative worlds, but understanding how readers create such worlds---populating them with characters, objects, and events---presents serious challenges across disciplines. Auditory imagery is thought to play a prominent role in this process, especially when representing characters' voices. Previous research has shown that direct reference to speech in stories (e.g., He said, ``I'm over here'') may prompt spontaneous activation of voice-selective auditory cortex more than indirect speech [Yao, B., Belin, P., \&amp; Scheepers, C. Silent reading of direct versus indirect speech activates voice-selective areas in the auditory cortex. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 23, 3146--3152, 2011]. However, it is unclear whether this effect reflects differential processing of speech or differences in linguistic content, source memory, or grammar. One way to test this is to compare direct reference effects for characters speaking and thinking in a story. Here, we present a multidisciplinary fMRI study of 21 readers' responses to characters' speech and thoughts during silent reading of short fictional stories. Activations relating to direct and indirect references were compared for both speaking and thinking. Eye-tracking and independent localizer tasks (auditory cortex and theory of mind [ToM]) established ROIs in which responses to stories could be tracked for individuals. Evidence of elevated auditory cortex responses to direct speech over indirect speech was observed, replicating previously reported effects; no reference effect was observed for thoughts. Moreover, a direct reference effect specific to speech was also evident in regions previously associated with inferring intentions from communication. Implications are discussed for the spontaneous representation of fictional characters and the potential roles of inner speech and ToM in this process.}

LITESCAPE.PT integrates traditional reading practices and `distant reading' approaches, along with collaborative work, relational databases, and geographic information systems (GIS) in order to classify and analyse excerpts from 350 works of Portuguese literature according to a set of ecological, socioeconomic, temporal and cultural themes. As we argue herein this combination of qualitative and quantitative methods---itself a response to the difficulty of obtaining external funding---can lead to (a) increased productivity, (b) the pursuit of new research goals, and (c) the creation of new knowledge about natural and cultural history. As proof of concept, the article presents two initial outcomes of the LITESCAPE.PT project: a case study documenting the evolving literary geography of Lisbon and a case study exploring the representation of wolves in Portuguese literature.},

By ``computational journalism'' the article refers to the increasingly ubiquitous forms of algorithmic, social scientific, and mathematical forms of newswork adopted by many 21st-century newsrooms and touted by many educational institutions as ``the future of news.'' By ``sociological approach,'' the article endorses a research model that brackets, at least temporarily, many of the current industry concerns with the practical usability of newsroom analysis. The bulk of the article outlines a series of six lenses through which such an approach to computational journalism might be carried out. Four of these lenses are drawn from Schudson's classic typology of the sociology of news---economic, political, cultural, and organizational approaches. In addition, the author adds Bordieuean field approaches and technological lenses to the mix. In each instance, the author discusses how particular approaches might need to be modified in order to study computational journalism in the digital age.},

The findings of this review showed that during reading, the amount of cognitive effort invested in text processing, whether induced by the text, the task, or the readers themselves, is usually reflected in longer total fixation times, both as a result of higher fixation frequencies and longer fixation durations.},

Previous research (Inhoff, Radach, Starr, \& Greenberg, 2000) showed that the presence of a parafoveal word that was similar to the foveal word facilitated processing of the foveal word. We used the gaze-contingent boundary paradigm (Rayner, 1975) to manipulate the parafoveal information that subjects received before or while fixating a target word (e.g., news) within a sentence. Specifically, a reader's parafovea could contain a repetition of the target (news), a correct preview of the posttarget word (once), an unrelated word (warm), random letters (cxmr), a nonword neighbor of the target (niws), a semantically related word (tale), or a nonword neighbor of that word (tule). Target fixation times were significantly lower in the parafoveal repetition condition than in all other conditions, suggesting that foveal processing can be facilitated by parafoveal repetition. We present a simple model framework that can account for these effects.},

  abstract = {Birth stories have become increasingly common on the internet, but they have received little attention as a computational dataset. These unsolicited, publicly posted stories provide rich descriptions of decisions, emotions, and relationships during a common but sometimes traumatic medical experience. These personal details can be illuminating for medical practitioners, and due to their shared structures, birth stories are also an ideal testing ground for narrative analysis techniques. We present an analysis of 2,847 birth stories from an online forum and demonstrate the utility of these stories for computational work. We discover clear sentiment, topic and persona-based patterns that both model the expected narrative event sequences of birth stories and highlight diverging pathways and exceptions to narrative norms. The authors' motivation to publicly post these personal stories can be a way to regain power after a surveilled and disempowering experience, and we explore power relationships between the personas in the stories, showing that these dynamics can vary with the type of birth (e.g., medicated vs unmedicated). Finally, birth stories exist in a space that is both public and deeply personal. This liminality poses a challenge for analysis and presentation, and we discuss tradeoffs and ethical practices for this collection.

Scholars denote external actors with these types of knowledge as interlopers or actors at the periphery of journalism. In this study, we follow two Swedish digital native data journalism start-ups operating in the Nordics from when they were founded in 2012 to 2019. Although the start-ups have been successful in news journalism over the years and acted as drivers for change in Nordic news innovation, they also have a presence in sectors other than journalism. This qualitative case study, which is based on interviews over time with the start-up founders and a qualitative analysis of blog posts written by the employees at the two start-ups, tells a story of journalists working at the periphery of legacy media, at least temporarily forced to leave journalism behind yet successfully using journalistic thinking outside of journalistic contexts.},

The last finding examines the relationship between students' critical thinking and their perception of the advantages of providing digital peer feedback. The correlation test's significant (2-tailed) value is found to be 0.000 {$<$} 0.05 in the result, indicating that the alternative hypothesis (H1) is accepted. The relationship was classified as weak level~since the Pearson correlation result (r-value) was 0.358.

However, place names are highly ambiguous and may change over time, which makes it especially hard to automatically ground mentions of places in historical texts to their real-world referents. Toponym disambiguation is a challenging problem in natural language processing, and has been approached in two different yet related tasks: toponym resolution and entity linking. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised method that combines the strengths of both approaches by exploiting both geographic and semantic features. We tested our method against a historical toponym resolution benchmark and improved the state of the art. We also created five datasets and tested the performance of two state-of-the-art out-of-the-box entity linking methods and also improved on their performance when only locations are considered.},

However, a text also contains much useful information in its style, or how it is written. This includes information about its author, its purpose, feelings it is meant to evoke, and more. This article develops a new type of lexical feature for use in stylistic text classification, based on taxonomies of various semantic functions of certain choice words or phrases. We demonstrate the usefulness of such features for the stylistic text classification tasks of determining author identity and nationality, the gender of literary characters, a text's sentiment (positive/negative evaluation), and the rhetorical character of scientific journal articles. We further show how the use of functional features aids in gaining insight about stylistic differences among different kinds of texts.}

Armstrong, "for what it reveals about human experience, and the very different perspective of neuroscience on how the brain works is part of that story." In How Literature Plays with the Brain, Armstrong examines the parallels between certain features of literary experience and functions of the brain. His central argument is that literature plays with the brain through experiences of harmony and dissonance which set in motion oppositions that are fundamental to the neurobiology of mental functioning. These oppositions negotiate basic tensions in the operation of the brain between the drive for pattern, synthesis, and constancy and the need for flexibility, adaptability, and openness to change.The challenge, Armstrong argues, is to account for the ability of readers to find incommensurable meanings in the same text, for example, or to take pleasure in art that is harmonious or dissonant, symmetrical or distorted, unified or discontinuous and disruptive. How Literature Plays with the Brain is the first book to use the resources of neuroscience and phenomenology to analyze aesthetic experience. For the neuroscientific community, the study suggests that different areas of research---the neurobiology of vision and reading, the brain-body interactions underlying emotions---may be connected to a variety of aesthetic and literary phenomena. For critics and students of literature, the study engages fundamental questions within the humanities: What is aesthetic experience? What happens when we read a literary work? How does the interpretation of literature relate to other ways of knowing?},

Our framework, distant viewing, is distinguished from other approaches by making explicit the interpretive nature of extracting semantic metadata from images. In other words, one must `view' visual materials before studying them. We illustrate the need for the interpretive process of viewing by simultaneously drawing on theories of visual semiotics, photography, and computer vision. Two illustrative applications of the distant viewing framework to our own research are draw upon to explicate the potential and breadth of the approach. A study of television series shows how facial detection is used to compare the role of actors within the narrative arcs across two competing series. An analysis of the Farm Security Administration--Office of War Information corpus of documentary photography is used to establish how photographic style compared and differed amongst those photographers involved with the collection. We then aim to show how our framework engages with current methodological and theoretical conversations occurring within the digital humanities.},

The Next Billion Users reveals that many assumptions about internet use in developing countries are wrong. After immersing herself in factory towns, slums, townships, and favelas, Payal Arora assesses real patterns of internet usage in India, China, South Africa, Brazil, and the Middle East. She finds Himalayan teens growing closer by sharing a single computer with common passwords and profiles. In China's gaming factories, the line between work and leisure disappears. In Riyadh, a group of young women organize a YouTube fashion show. Why do citizens of states with strict surveillance policies appear to care so little about their digital privacy? Why do Brazilians eschew geo-tagging on social media? What drives young Indians to friend "foreign" strangers on Facebook and give "missed calls" to people? The Next Billion Users answers these questions and many more. Through extensive fieldwork, Arora demonstrates that the global poor are far from virtuous utilitarians who mainly go online to study, find jobs, and obtain health information. She reveals habits of use bound to intrigue everyone from casual internet users to developers of global digital platforms to organizations seeking to reach the next billion internet users.-- Provided by publisher},

Sam did [ ] too.'') categorize as ungrammatical many sentences that language users find acceptable (they ``undergenerate''); semantic accounts overgenerate. We propose that a processing theory, together with a syntactic account, does a better job of describing and explaining the data on verb phrase-ellipsis. Five acceptability judgment experiments supported a ``VP recycling hypothesis,'' which claims that when a syntactically-matching antecedent is not available, the listener/reader creates one using the materials at hand. Experiments 1 and 2 used verb phrase ellipsis sentences with antecedents ranging from perfect (a verb phrase in matrix verb phrase position) to impossible (a verb phrase containing only a deverbal word). Experiments 3 and 4 contrasted antecedents in verbal versus nominal gerund subjects. Experiment 5 explored the possibility that speakers are particularly likely to go beyond the grammar and produce elided constituents without perfect matching antecedents when the antecedent needed is less marked than the antecedent actually produced. This experiment contrasted active (unmarked) and passive antecedents to show that readers seem to honor such a tendency.}

Yet even if this problem cannot yet be solved for many important and complex topics--democracy, inequality, violence, stability, and many more--there is much left to learn; in particular, clear theories that provide better insight into the central mechanisms at work. These theories can help orient new empirical work, thus fueling a virtuous cycle between empirical and theoretical insights. In this ambitious book. Ashworth et al address this key challenge in the field with a new vision of how to connect empirical and theoretical work, one rooted in the idea of "all else equal." Theory, the authors argue, implicitly rests of the idea of "all-else-equal," and it's precisely this question that empirical work attempts to confirm. Thus theory and empirics have an intrinsic connection, and in recognizing this scholars can bridge the gap between the two. The first part of the book examines the "all-else-equal" connection and goes on to show how how theoretical models yield empirical implications and how substantive identification is the lynch-pin of a credible research design. The second part then follows the progressive back-and-forth between theory and empirics in existing scholarship, breaking these interactions into five types: reinterpreting, elaboration, distinguishing, disentangling, and modeling the research design. Each chapter in this section provides concrete examples, discussing a handful of papers that illustrates the relevant interaction between theory and empirics. The overall goal of the book is to facilitate a closer and more productive interaction between theory and empirics in social science"},

This chapter will consider this tradition of research, its intellectual influences, historical trajectory in psychology and the radical critique it has directed towards many of its taken-for-granted concepts. It will also outline some core principles in DA and demonstrate how they are examined in the analysis of discourse.},

A critical geography and a new historicism have reoriented many humanists and social science disciplines. Like the spatial turn, the temporal turn now grounds the analysis of everything from literature to sociology in new kinds of contexts. The exciting challenge before us now is integrating those new perspectives, taking advantage of what they have to teach us.  The spatial turn began within the discipline of geography itself.

The reader is guided step-by-step through a range of real data sets, allowing them to analyse acoustic data, construct grammatical trees for a variety of languages, quantify register variation in corpus linguistics, and measure experimental data using state-of-the-art models. The visualization of data plays a key role, both in the initial stages of data exploration and later on when the reader is encouraged to criticize various models. Containing over 40 exercises with model answers, this book will be welcomed by all linguists wishing to learn more about working with and presenting quantitative data.},

While computer scientists have produced powerful new tools for automated analyses of such "big data," they lack the theoretical direction necessary to extract meaning from them. Meanwhile, cultural sociologists have produced sophisticated theories of the social origins of meaning, but lack the methodological capacity to explore them beyond micro-levels of analysis. I propose a synthesis of these two fields that adjoins conventional qualitative methods and new techniques for automated analysis of large amounts of text in iterative fashion. First, I explain how automated text extraction methods may be used to map the contours of cultural environments. Second, I discuss the potential of automated text-classification methods to classify different types of culture such as frames, schema, or symbolic boundaries. Finally, I explain how these new tools can be combined with conventional qualitative methods to trace the evolution of such cultural elements over time. While my assessment of the integration of big data and cultural sociology is optimistic, my conclusion highlights several challenges in implementing this agenda. These include a lack of information about the social context in which texts are produced, the construction of reliable coding schemes that can be automated algorithmically, and the relatively high entry costs for cultural sociologists who wish to develop the technical expertise currently necessary to work with big data.]}

  abstract = {Purpose               -- The purpose of this paper is to describe an assessment design for the Developing Librarian training program. The Developing Librarian training program created by and for librarians and professional staff in the Humanities and History division is a two-year training program to acquire new skills and methodologies to support the digital humanities. The program is based on the assumption that learning must happen in context; therefore the training is project based with all participants engaged in building a digital humanities research site as a team. This approach enables participants to learn about new tools in a sustained manner that parallels the way humanities researchers are likely to use them.                                         Design/methodology/approach               -- In order to measure the success of achieving this goal, program designers defined three objectives: learn tools and methods that support the emerging research needs and trends in the humanities; create a more interesting and engaging work environment for librarians and professional staff; and engage effectively with the humanities research community across the University. Three methods/instruments were: Explicit Self-Reflections to assess what participants learned in each training unit; the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale to measure how participants feel about their work before and after the training program; and the Skill Set, Knowledge and Attitude Assessment to be administered at completion to measure the effectiveness of the training program as a whole.                                         Findings               -- At the time of writing, the Developing Librarian Project is mid-way to completion, and implementation of the assessment plan is ongoing. Based on these self-reports, there is evidence that the training program has been effective, and participants have been successful in meeting most of the learning objectives identified in the units completed. While self-assessment of knowledge and skills may have its limitations, this technique is proving adequate and efficient for achieving the program's goals. This method encourages experimentation and establishes failure as an important aspect of the learning process.                                         Research limitations/implications               -- An assessment approach such as this does not measure the impact of training and development on digital humanities research, but initiates a valuable process, highlighting skills gaps at the individual, and organizational levels. These data are important for identifying and implementing appropriate training opportunities for librarians supporting emergent research activities and for understanding what skills and professional preparation are needed for new staff recruited into the organization.                                         Originality/value               -- A successful training program should be benchmarked, evaluated in a substantive and systematic way, and improved continuously. A formal assessment plan, directly tied to clearly articulated objectives, helps assure that such a program is effectively evaluated, iteratively developed, and successfully implemented. The Developing Librarian Project provides a useful model of how an academic library can leverage assessment and evaluation processes to identify skills gaps and training needs and generate actionable data for improving staff learning.},

However, instead of simply assuming that foregrounding and absorption are mutually exclusive, they should also be considered as co-occurring: being absorbed as a result of a deviating aspect of a story. In the present paper we examine the co-occurrence of responses by means of a data-driven qualitative approach. The analysis of interviews about absorbed experiences with written and cinematic fictional narratives focused on occurrences of and responses to perceived deviation. We identified seven strategies in response to deviation that may be described through three underlying dimensions: absorption, agency, and valence. Findings suggest that perceived deviation, rather than obstructing absorption, is associated with intense and meaningful engagement with narratives.}

While the formal curriculum provides structured learning objectives and content, the hidden curriculum shapes students' socialization, sense of belonging, and access to opportunities within academic settings.\, For diverse students, a hidden curriculum often reinforces existing power dynamics and inequities, creating additional barriers to their success. In many cases, the norms and expectations embedded within the hidden curriculum reflect dominant cultural norms, leaving students from marginalized backgrounds feeling alienated or intentionally excluded. Mentors and academic institutions play crucial roles in helping diverse students navigate the hidden curriculum of educational institutions by providing mentorship and resources to address the challenges of hidden curricula. In this paper, we introduce the importance of "NOW":\, 1) Nomenclature - What is Hidden Curriculum, 2) Opportunity - Opportunities to Address Hidden Curriculum in Higher Education, and 3) Willingness - Fostering an action plan for success in higher education. This paper will introduce a socioecological model for mentoring to address hidden curriculum at the individual, interpersonal, and institutional levels. At the individual and interpersonal level, we will discuss actions students and their mentors can take to develop their mentoring relationships. At the institutional level, we will identify opportunities to support diverse students and their mentors.}

Taking as input timestamped text, we exploit latent correlations among events to learn a set of event classes (such as Born, Graduates High School, and Becomes Citizen), along with the typical times in a person?s life when those events occur. In a quantitative evaluation at the task of predicting a person?s age for a given event, we find that our generative model outperforms a strong linear regression baseline, along with simpler variants of the model that ablate some features. The abstract event classes that we learn allow us to perform a large-scale analysis of 242,970 Wikipedia biographies. Though it is known that women are greatly underrepresented on Wikipedia?not only as editors (Wikipedia, 2011) but also as subjects of articles (Reagle and Rhue, 2011)?we find that there is a bias in their characterization as well, with biographies of women containing significantly more emphasis on events of marriage and divorce than biographies of men.}

  abstract = {A popular argument that is commonly put forth as an explanation linking digital technologies to political polarization is related to their ability to foster the emergence of echo chambers where extremist ideas are amplified. Sunstein (2018), a leading proponent of this view, argues that the main characteristic of social networking sites is that they allow politically like-minded individuals to find one another. In this environment, citizens are only exposed to information that reinforces their political views and remain isolated from other individuals with opposing views, in part due to the filtering effects of ranking algorithms that generate filter bubbles (Pariser, 2011) and create incentives for publishers to share clickbait and hyperpartisan content (Benkler et al, 2018). The outcome of this process is a society that is increasingly segregated along partisan lines, and where compromise becomes unlikely due to rising mistrust on public officials, media outlets, and ordinary citizens on the other side of the ideological spectrum.}

  abstract = {Prior research has shown that cumulative written fiction exposure is correlated with (Mar, Oatley, Hirsch, de la Paz, \& Peterson, 2006; Mar, Oatley, \& Peterson, 2009) and 1-time exposure to literary fiction increases (e.g., Black \& Barnes, 2015a; Kidd \& Castano, 2013) performance on an emotion-reading task. However, Panero and colleagues (2016) found that although lifetime fiction exposure is a reliable predictor of performance, the causal effects previously observed may be more fragile (see also Samur, Tops, \& Koole, 2017). The current article is an exploration of the extent to which the ability of fiction to affect social cognition may depend not only on what is read, but also how one reads. Specifically, an argument is made that the effect of fiction on social cognition may depend on the degree to which the reader contributes imaginatively to the text and that, although drawing meaning from literary fiction may require high levels of imaginative engagement, popular and genre fiction may allow for engaging in this way. This stance is discussed with respect to the role that emotional investment in a story and its characters might play in influencing readers of popular fiction to read in a "literary" way.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a digital library developed within the ``Towards a Digital Dante Encyclopaedia'' project, a three years Italian National Research Project that aims at building services supporting scholars in creating, evolving and consulting a digital encyclopaedia of Dante Alighieri's works. The digital library is based on a knowledge base storing knowledge on the primary sources that Dante refers to in his works, i.e. the works of other authors Dante refers to in his texts. At present, this information is scattered on many paper books, making it difficult to systematically overview the cultural background of Dante and to obtain a well-founded perception of how this background was gradually set up in time. The same applies also to other authors, therefore the applicability of our work extends well beyond the specific author we are considering in our project. The digital library that we are building is based on an ontology for representing the knowledge on one author's works and on the primary sources embedded in the commentaries to these works. Following this approach, a semantic network of Dante's works and of references to primary sources of these works was created. Furthermore, a web application allowing users to explore the semantic network in various ways and to visualize statistical information about the references as charts and tables was developed.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Digital competence has gained a strong prominence in the educational context, being one of the key competencies that teachers must master in today's society. Although most models and frameworks focus on the pre-university level, there is a growing interest in knowing the state of digital competencies of university teachers, that is, the set of knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for a teacher to make effective use of technologies. The aim of this research is to present a systematic review of the literature in the Web of Science and Scopus, to identify, analyze and classify the published articles between 2000 and 2021 on digital competences, and thus find and improve the research being done on digital skills and future avenues of teachers in the university context. The SciMAT software is used in the analysis. The initial search reveals more than 343 articles in English, of which 152 are duplicates and 135 are not related to the topic of study. After this filtering, 56 articles are obtained and analyzed in depth. The results reveal a predominance of research that focuses on analyzing teachers' self-assessment and reflection of their digital competencies. Teachers recognize that they have a low or medium--low digital competence, as well as the absence of certain competencies, especially those related to the evaluation of educational practice. Despite the multiple studies that address this issue, it is necessary to continue improving research in this area, deepening the assessment of teachers' digital competencies and design, on this basis, more practical and personalized training programs that respond to the needs of teachers in the digital era.},

A group of healthy volunteers was shown four types of emotional stimuli categorized as High Valence High Arousal, High Valence Low Arousal, Low Valence High Arousal and Low Valence Low Arousal for around thirty minutes for emotion elicitation. Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis are used and compared to the emotional class classification. Classification of stimuli into one of the four classes has been attempted on the basis of measurements on responses of experimental subjects. If classification is restricted within the responses of a specific individual, the classification results show high accuracy. However, if the problem is extended to entire population, the accuracy drops significantly.},

The authors show that big data are not a new type of social science data but actually one of the oldest forms of social science data. In addition, big data are not necessarily digital data. Regardless, current methodological debates often assume that ``big data'' are ``digital data.'' The authors thus also show that digital data have a big drawback concerning data quality because they do not cover the whole population -- due to so-called digital divides, not everybody is on the internet, and who is on the internet, is socially structured. The result is a selection bias. Based on this analysis, the paper concludes that big data and digital data are data like any other type of data -- they have both advantages and specific blind spots. So rather than glorifying or demonising them, it seems much more sensible to discuss which specific advantages and drawbacks they have as well as when and how they are better suited for answering specific research questions and when and how other types of data are better suited -- these are the questions that are addressed in this HSR Forum.]}

A group of Malaysian undergraduates (n = 71) took an onscreen test consisting of two IELTS reading passages with 11 test items. Eye movements of a random sample of these participants (n = 38) were tracked. Stimulated recall interview data was collected to assist in interpretation of the eye-tracking data.Findings demonstrated significant differences between successful and unsuccessful test takers on a number of dimensions, including their ability to read expeditiously (Khalifa \& Weir, 2009), and their focus on particular aspects of the test items and texts, while no observable difference was noted in other items. This offers new insights into the cognitive processes of candidates during reading tests. Findings will be of value to examination boards preparing reading tests, to teachers and learners, and also to researchers interested in the cognitive processes of readers.}

Twenty-one participants performed a semantic decision task on the target verbs. In contrast to single word studies no early posterior negativity was present. However, emotion effects in ERPs were evident in a late positive complex (LPC) for negative, high-arousal words in comparison to neutral words. Interestingly, the LPC was unaffected by pure arousal variation when valence was controlled for, indicating the importance of valence for this emotion-related ERP effect.},

We find that corrections from Republicans speaking against their partisan interest are most likely to persuade respondents to acknowledge and agree with the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change. The extent of these effects vary by the partisanship of the recipient. Our results suggest that the partisan gap on climate change can be reduced by highlighting the views of elite Republicans who acknowledge the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change.}

Since the evocation of space is an important narrative tool, this raises questions about the nature of geographical representation in literary utopias, and continuities and differences that can be observed between pre- and post-Enlightenment works. This chapter explores these questions as part of a general introduction to utopian geography. Following a brief review of some recent approaches, I examine the ideological significance of imaginative geographies in a small selection of pre- and post-Enlightenment works. I conclude that utopia is a spatial literary form and that the modern works discussed here complicate traditional spatial comparisons with additional worlds and show a greater interest in the particularity of place.},

  abstract = {"In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the linguistic situation in Europe was one of remarkable fluidity. Latin, the great scholarly lingua franca of the medieval period, was beginning to crack as the tectonic plates shifted beneath it, but the vernaculars had not yet crystallized into the national languages that they would later become, and multilingualism was rife. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the world, languages were coming into contact with an intensity that they had never had before, influencing each other and throwing up all manner of hybrids and pidgins as peoples tried to communicate using the semiotic resources they had available. Of interest to linguists, literary scholars and historians, amongst others, this interdisciplinary volume explores the linguistic dynamics operating in Europe and beyond in the crucial centuries between 1400 and 1800. Assuming a state of individual, societal and functional multilingualism, when codeswitching was the norm, and languages themselves were fluid, unbounded and porous, it explores the shifting relationships that existed between various tongues in different geographical contexts, as well as some of the myths and theories that arose to make sense of them"--},

  abstract = {A mismatch between largely absolute Newtonian models of space in GIScience and the relational spaces of critical human geography has contributed to mutual disinterest between the fields. Critical GIS has offered an intellectual critique of GIScience without substantially altering how particular key geographical concepts are expressed in data structures. Although keystone ideas in GIScience such as Tobler's ``First Law'' and the modifiable areal unit problem speak to enduring concerns of human geography, they have drawn little interest from that field. Here, we suggest one way to reformulate the computational approach to the region for relational space, so that regions emerge not through proximity in an absolute space or similarities in intensive properties, but according to their similarities in relations. We show how this might operate theoretically and empirically, working through three illustrative examples. Our approach gestures toward reformulating key terms in GIScience like distance, proximity, networks, and spatial building blocks such as the polygon. Re-engaging the challenges of representing geographical concepts computationally can yield new kinds of GIS and GIScience resonant with theoretical ideas in human geography, and also lead to critical human geographic practices less antagonistic to computation.           ,              Reformuler la science des SIG pour les espaces relationnels             Une incompatibilit{\'e} entre les mod{\`e}les newtoniens largement absolus de l'espace dans la science de l'information g{\'e}ographique et les espaces relationnels de la g{\'e}ographie humaine critique a contribu{\'e} {\`a} un d{\'e}sint{\'e}r{\^e}t mutuel entre ces domaines.

Bergstrom, a computational biologist, and West, an information scientist, catalogue bullshit in its many forms, explaining and offering readers the tools to see through the obfuscations, deliberate and careless, that dominate every realm of our lives. They instruct readers to ask: Who is saying it? How do they know? What do they have to gain by persuading me? Are the numbers or results too good or too dramatic to be true? Is the claim comparing like with like or apples and oranges? Is it confirming your personal bias? In this lively guide to everything from misleading statistics to "fake news," Bergstrom and West help you recognize bullshit whenever and wherever you encounter it--in data, in conversation, even within yourself--and explain it to your crystal-loving aunt or casually racist uncle. Now more than ever, calling bullshit is crucial to a properly functioning community, whether it be a circle of friends, a network of academics, or the citizenry of a nation"--},

The results indicate, on the whole, that both pleasingness and interestingness increase with novelty. These findings run counter to those of experiments indicating an inverse relation between novelty and verbally expressed preference. Two further experiments examined effects of some variables that might account for this apparent discrepancy. Homogeneous sequences declined in judged ``pleasantness'' more than sequences in which several stimuli were interspersed, and simple stimuli became less pleasant as they became less novel, while complex stimuli declined less or became more pleasant. The findings are related to hypotheses regarding mechanisms of hedonic value. Two crucial predictions were confirmed in a fifth experiment.}

Concern is with later, school-age language development, in the conviction that the long developmental route of language acquisition can profitably be examined in the context of extended discourse. Findings are reviewed from a cross-linguistic project that elicited narrative and expository texts in both speech and writing at four age groups: (9--10 years, 12--13, 16--17 and adults). Clear developmental patterns emerge from middle childhood to adulthood, with significant shifts in adolescence; global-level text organization is mastered earlier in narratives than in expository essays, but the latter promote more advanced use of local-level lexicon and syntax; and spoken texts are more spread out than their denser written counterparts in clause-linkage, referential content and lexical usage. These and other findings are discussed in terms of the growth and reorganization of knowledge about types of discourse and text-embedded language use.},

In particular, the work examines how the enlightenment values embedded within the culture and materiality of digital technology can be used to explain the changes that are occurring across society.Critical Theory and the Digital draws from the critical concepts developed by critical theorists to demonstrate how the digital needs to be understood within a dialectic of potentially democratizing and totalizing technical power.

The appropriate design for a corpus therefore depends upon what it is meant to represent. The representativeness of the corpus, in turn, determines the kinds of research questions that can be addressed and the generalizability of the results of the research. For example, a corpus composed primarily of news reportage would not allow a general investigation of variation in English. Similarly, research based on a corpus containing a single type of conversation -- such as conversations between teenagers -- could not be generalized to conversation overall. Thus, whether you are designing a corpus of your own, choosing a corpus to use in a study, or reading others' corpus-based work, issues of representativeness in corpus design are crucial.It is important to realize up front that representing a language -- or even part of a language -- is a problematic task. We do not know the full extent of variation in languages or all the contextual variables that need to be covered in order to capture all variation in texts. However, attention to certain issues will ensure that a corpus is as representative as possible, given our current knowledge of language. This methodology box introduces these issues, as well as some means for improving corpus design in the future.},

Three main accounts of the adaptive function of storytelling include (a) manipulating the behavior of the audience to enhance the fitness of the narrator, (b) transmitting survival-relevant information while avoiding the costs involved in the first-hand acquisition of that information, and (c) maintaining social bonds or group-level cooperation. We assess the substantial evidence collected in experimental and ethnographic studies for each account. These accounts do not always appeal to the specific features of storytelling above and beyond language use in general. We propose that the specific adaptive value of storytelling lies in making sense of non-routine, uncertain, or novel situations, thereby enabling the collaborative development of previously acquired skills and knowledge, but also promoting social cohesion by strengthening intragroup identity and clarifying intergroup relations.           ,              Bietti, Tilston and Bangerter take an evolutionary approach towards memory transmission and storytelling, arguing that storytelling plays a central role in the creation and transmission of cultural information. They suggest that storytelling is a vehicle to transmit survival-related information that helps to avoid the costs involved in the first-hand acquisition of that information and contributes to the maintenance of social bonds and group-level cooperation. Furthermore, Bietti et al. argue that, going beyond storytelling's individualist role of manipulating the audience to enhance fitness of the narrator, that these adaptive functions of storytelling may well be assigned to other forms of language use besides narration (e.g., instructional discourse and argumentation). Based on this evidence, Bietti and colleagues claim that the specific adaptive function of storytelling lies in making sense of non-routine, uncertain, or novel situations, thereby enabling collective sensemaking.},

In Experiment 1, local context was manipulated so that the meaning of the ambiguous word either remained the same or changed from the 1st to 2nd encounter. In Experiments 2 and 3, global context was manipulated by shifting the discourse topic between the 2 instances of the ambiguous word. Gaze durations on the 2nd instance of the ambiguous word were shorter when the meaning remained consistent than when the meaning changed, and this facilitation was impervious to changes in the discourse structure. In contrast, processing time in the region immediately following the target was longer when the word meaning changed, but only when the topic of the discourse remained the same throughout the passage. When the topic was shifted, this effect disappeared. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

I argue that while there is a sense in which a FIS text can achieve relevance by creating a sense of mutuality that is unmediated by the presence of the author, there are also features which allow the author to signal his own attitudes towards the characters whose thoughts he is representing. Indeed, as Dillon and Kirchhoff (1976) and Fludernik (1993) have shown, an author is able to communicate a sense of ironic distance even if he does not necessarily explicitly comment on his characters. Using examples from Katherine Mansfield, Malcolm Lowry and Virginia Woolf, I show that parentheticals play a role both in establishing a sense of affective mutuality between reader and character and in establishing a sense of irony by placing represented thoughts in a ludicrous light.}

Sentences were read in Double Negation (DN; the `she answered something' reading of she didn't answer nothing) and Negative Concord (NC; the `she answered nothing' reading of she didn't answer nothing) biasing contexts. Despite the social stigma associated with NC, and linguistic assumptions that Standard English has a DN grammar, in which each syntactic negation necessarily contributes a semantic negation, our results show that Standard English speakers generate both NC and DN interpretations, and that their interpretation is affected by the syntactic structure of the negative sentence. Participants spent more time reading the critical sentence and rereading the context sentence when negative object sentences were paired with DN-biasing contexts and when negative subject sentences were paired with NC-biasing contexts. This suggests that, despite not producing NC, they find NC interpretations of negative object sentences easier to generate than DN interpretations. The results illustrate the utility of online measures when investigating socially stigmatized construction types.},

This method is based on what we will introduce as distant supervision' and will allow us to improve computational modelling in the digital humanities by including new methods of supervised learning. Using recurrent neural networks, we generated a training corpus and were able to train a highly accurate model that qualitatively and quantitatively improved a baseline model. To demonstrate our new approach experimentally, we employ a real-life research question based on existing humanities collections. We use neural network based sentiment analysis to decode Holocaust memories and present a methodology to combine supervised and unsupervised sentiment analysis to analyse the oral history interviews of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Finally, we employed three advanced methods of computational semantics. These helped us decipher the decisions by the neural network and understand, for instance, the complex sentiments around family memories in the testimonies.},

By approaching the modeling this way, the authors are able to build off a regression foundation and progressively estimate and evaluate more complex models. In the model comparison framework, the article illustrates the value of using likelihood tests to contrast alternative models (rather than the typical reliance on tests of significance involving individual parameters), and it provides code in the open-source language R to allow readers to replicate the results. The article concludes with practical guidelines for estimating growth models.}

While in top-down salience, perceivers endogenously direct their attention to a certain stimulus, in bottom-up salience, it is the stimulus itself which attracts attention. In prototypical cases of bottom-up salience, the stimulus stands out because it is incongruous with a given ground by virtue of intrinsic physical characteristics. But a stimulus may also cause surprise by virtue of deviating from a cognitive ground, e.g., when violating social or probabilistic expectations. This has prompted researchers to examine the relationship between expectations and the perceptual salience of linguistic stimuli in new ways. This e-book features contributions from different scientific frameworks. The reader will find commentaries, reviews, and original research articles on models of sociolinguistic and morphological salience, the role of attention, affect, and predictability, and on how salient items are processed, categorized and learned. Taken together, the articles in this volume contribute to our understanding of how the perceptual salience of linguistic forms and variants can be theoretically framed and methodologically operationalized in different areas of linguistic processing"--Page 2},

Consideration of the neurobiology of the sound structure of language and the studies of aphasic patients suggest that the organization and ultimate implementation of the phonological sound structure is broadly represented in the left dominant hemisphere and deficits relate to selection and planning in speech production and access in speech perception. With respect to the neurobiology of the lexicon and syntax, evoked related potentials (ERP) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies provide support for electrophysiological markers for lexical meaning and syntactic structures, and, in conjunction with data from aphasic patients, suggest that with the possible exception of productive agrammatism, the neural basis of the lexicon and syntax is broadly represented. This chapter uses a modular approach to language as a theoretical framework by studying separately phonology, the lexicon, and syntax; the results of this research suggest that there is little evidence to support the view that the organization of the language system itself is modular. More specifically, they reflect impairments to those processing routines used to access this information. This view is consistent with clinical and experimental findings showing similar patterns of linguistic impairment across different aphasia groups, and also accounts for the fact that nearly all aphasic patients show some degree of deficit in phonological, lexical, and syntactic processing, although the constellation of abilities and disabilities that these patients display is nevertheless quite different.},

This is because oculomotor orienting (gaze) behaviours are the primary control point for intake of visual information, so observing how they respond to different stimuli enables inference about cognitive processes such as attention, memory and processing speed. The capacity to observe gaze behaviour is strengthened by modern eye-tracking technologies that provide information about gaze derived from non-invasive recordings of subtle pupillary movements that are highly resolved in time (typically 60 Hz) and space (0.3{$^\circ$}).One of the major challenges of 21st century global child health is early identification of children who are developing atypically. This drive comes from parents, eager for diagnostic certainty and frustrated by the need to wait, often until school age, before problems are confirmed. The urgency to do more to identify risk factors in early life is reinforced by recent understanding that the preschool years offer a window of brain plasticity,1 when interventions designed to improve outcome may yield most benefit. Indeed, the principle of early detection for early intervention is a cornerstone of the Chief Medical Officer for England\&\#039;s strategy (Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer 2012. Our Children Deserve Better: Prevention Pays). In addition, practitioners long for precision diagnosis because stratification of risk groups into diagnostic categories and subcategories could permit earlier and targeted intervention.Eye-tracking is a {\textbackslash}ldots}

Such rhetoric helps deflect attention from the profitable and surveillant accumulation of data and the worrisome concentration of power in a handful of companies. Alert to this problematic political economy, the issue's editors engage recent theories of data capitalism and argue that attention to processes of datafication helps to elude the pitfalls of data positivism, data universalism, and unintentional criti-hype. As the authors touch upon each contribution to this special issue, they call for critical AI studies to forge an interdisciplinary community of practice, alert to ontological commitments, design justice principles, and spaces of dissensus.},

The Spatial Humanities aims to re-orient-and perhaps revolutionize-humanities scholarship by critically engaging the technology and specifically directing it to the subject matter of the humanities. To this end, the contributors explore the potential of spatial methods such as text-based geographical analysis, multimedia GIS, animated maps, deep contingency, deep mapping, and the geo-spatial semantic web.},

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize `best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.}

  abstract = {This study analyzes the presence of urban space in 20th century science fiction in English using computational methods. Three theoretical approaches are used to model urban space as a measurable feature. First, urban space is formalized as a topic. LDA topic modeling is used to retrieve the urban topic from the corpus and estimate its presence in each book. Secondly, urban space is formalized as the sum of the linguistic fragments that form a setting. A list of urban terms is created and their frequency is measured for each novel. Lastly, cityspace is formalized as the number of references to urban locations. Textual Geographies' geographic data was used to measure the presence of named urban locations in each book. The results of these approaches all point to similar conclusions. A low presence of urban space is found in science fiction compared to general fiction, alongside a historical trend. Urban presence in science fiction is greater at the beginning of the 20th century, declines in the 30s and 40s, and successively increases in the 50s. No such dip is present in other types of fiction across the twentieth century.},

With the advent of neuroimaging methods---and particularly of functional magnetic resonance imaging---during the last decade of the twentieth century, the possibilities of scientific inquiry within this domain have taken on a new dimension. First, neuroimaging techniques allow for a systematic and fine-grained probing of the functional neuroanatomy of language in healthy individuals. Moreover, they provide new avenues of exploration with respect to classical psycholinguistic questions in sentence comprehension, such as the modularity vs. interactivity debate. Neuroimaging studies of language comprehension are thus suited to provide further information not only about the neural substrate of language comprehension but also with respect to its internal organisation. In view of the fact that the overall neural networks subserving language comprehension have, by now, been documented in a large number of studies, this article considers only direct contrasts between language conditions.},

  abstract = {Emotion modeling has been an active area of research for almost two decades now. In spite of the growing and diverse body of work in emotion modeling, designing and developing emotion models remains an art, with few standards and systematic guidelines available to guide the design process, and to validate the resulting models. This state-of-the-art volume includes extended versions of eight papers presented at two workshops: Standards in Emotion Modeling, SEM 2011, held in Leiden, The Netherlands, in August 2011, which focused on the challenges, progress and open questions regarding emotion modeling standards, and Emotional and Empathic Agents, EEA 2012, held in conjunction with AAMAS 2012, in Valencia, Spain, in June 2012, which focused on strategies for reducing the complexity of affective models and model re-use. The papers have been organized into two sections: generic models and frameworks, and evaluations of specific models. They represent a sampling of the current efforts toward the development of more systematic methods for emotion modeling, toward the development of standards in emotion model design and validation, and toward more pragmatic approaches to model development, including model component sharing and re-use. The topics range from efforts to define minimum functionalities for agent emotion models and provide tools for systematic comparisons of alternative approaches through approaches to integrating multiple processing levels within an agent architecture to papers exploring the best means of generating empathy and supportive behavior in virtual agents and attempts to address the requirements for realistic modeling of affective expressions across multiple types of social interaction (individual, group and cultural)},

What do a seventeenth-century mortality table (whose causes of death include "fainted in a bath," "frighted," and "itch"); the identification of South Africans during apartheid as European, Asian, colored, or black; and the separation of machine- from hand-washables have in common? All are examples of classification---the scaffolding of information infrastructures.             In Sorting Things Out, Geoffrey C. Bowker and Susan Leigh Star explore the role of categories and standards in shaping the modern world. In a clear and lively style, they investigate a variety of classification systems, including the International Classification of Diseases, the Nursing Interventions Classification, race classification under apartheid in South Africa, and the classification of viruses and of tuberculosis.             The authors emphasize the role of invisibility in the process by which classification orders human interaction. They examine how categories are made and kept invisible, and how people can change this invisibility when necessary. They also explore systems of classification as part of the built information environment. Much as an urban historian would review highway permits and zoning decisions to tell a city's story, the authors review archives of classification design to understand how decisions have been made. Sorting Things Out has a moral agenda, for each standard and category valorizes some point of view and silences another. Standards and classifications produce advantage or suffering. Jobs are made and lost; some regions benefit at the expense of others. How these choices are made and how we think about that process are at the moral and political core of this work. The book is an important empirical source for understanding the building of information infrastructures.},

In this paper we make the less restrictive assumption that such a normal, homo- scedastic, linear model is appropriate after some suitable transformation has been applied to the y's. Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples. 1.}

Across traditional narratives, a consistent underlying story structure emerged that revealed three primary processes: staging, plot progression, and cognitive tension. No evidence emerged to indicate that adherence to normative story structures was related to the popularity of the story. Last, analysis of fact-driven texts revealed structures that differed from story-based narratives.},

Data journalism can involve all sorts of skills and people, from those who are good at getting information in the first place, to those who can pull stories out of it, those who can write the stories, make information visual, or make data interactive. Increasingly, data-driven journalism is not just about telling stories but is making products that people can use, from searchable databases to apps. A great way to get data for exclusive stories is to use the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to request information from public bodies including data and documents. One of the basic principles of data visualisation is to avoid using 3D effects: these not only add unnecessary visual information but it can actively distort the chart. People can focus on finding stories in new datasets released by government organisations or other bodies, or develop their visual skills by creating compelling maps and infographics.},

Very few studies have investigated emotion regulation in the context in which it is usually deployed, namely, the complexity of everyday life. We address this in the current paper by reporting findings of two experience-sampling studies (Ns = 46 and 95) investigating the use of six emotion-regulation strategies (reflection, reappraisal, rumination, distraction, expressive suppression, and social sharing) and their associations with changes in positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) in daily life. Regarding the relative use of emotion-regulation strategies, a highly similar ordering was found across both studies with distraction being used more than sharing and reappraisal. While the use of all six strategies was positively correlated both within- and between-persons, different strategies were associated with distinct affective consequences: Suppression and rumination were associated with increases in NA and decreases in PA, whereas reflection was associated with increases in PA across both studies. Additionally, reappraisal, distraction, and social sharing were related to increases in PA in Study 2. Discussion focuses on how the current findings fit with theoretical models of emotion regulation and with previous evidence from experimental and retrospective studies.

However, misconceptions regarding EBM and SDM are common in clinical practice, and these biases might unintentionally be transmitted to medical trainees through a~hidden curriculum. The current study explores how assumptions of EBM and SDM can be hidden in formal curriculum material such as PowerPoint slides.  Methods We conducted a~qualitative content analysis using a~purposive sample of 18~PowerPoints on the management of upper respiratory tract infections. We identified concepts pertaining to decision making using theory-driven codes taken from the fields of EBM and SDM. We then re-analyzed the coded text using a~constructivist latent thematic approach to develop a~rich description of conceptualizations of decision making in relation to EBM and SDM frameworks.  Results PowerPoint slides can relay a~hidden curriculum, which can normalize: pathophysiological reasoning, unexplained variations in clinical care, the use of EBM mimics, defensive medicine, an unrealistic portrayal of benefits, and paternalism.  Discussion Addressing the hidden curriculum in formal curricular material should be explored as a~novel strategy to foster a~positive attitude towards EBM and SDM and to improve patient outcomes by encouraging the use of these skills.},

Little attention has previously been paid in cognitive science to the specifics of how point of view is identified during reading. This essay reports on an experiment designed to examine how readers respond to a narrative style that has attracted a great deal of interest from both stylisticians and literary critics: free indirect discourse. The experiment tested two questions in particular: (1) Do readers hear a `dual voice' when reading passages of free indirect discourse? and (2) What kind of `contexts' influence the identification of point of view? Some critics have noted the importance of the preceding co-text in deciding whose point of view is present in ambiguous passages; this experiment suggests that the succeeding co-text might also be relevant. This in turn has implications for the flexibility of the reading process, especially when more than one point of view may be present.},

Recent theorizing suggests, however, that the human brain relies on two affective processing systems, one working on the basis of discrete emotion categories, and the other working along affective dimensions. Presenting participants with an orthogonal manipulation of happiness and positivity in a lexical decision task, the present study meant to test the appropriateness of this assumption in emotion word recognition. Behavioral and electroencephalographic data revealed independent effects for both variables, with happiness affecting the early visual N1 component, while positivity affected an N400-like component and the late positive complex. These results are interpreted as evidence for a sequential processing of affective information, with discrete emotions being the basis for later dimensional appraisal processes.},

  abstract = {Modernist authors such as Virginia Woolf and James Joyce greatly expanded the use of `free indirect discourse', a form of third-person narration that is strongly influenced by the language of a viewpoint character. Unlike traditional approaches to analyzing characterization using common words, such as those based on Burrows (1987), the nature of free indirect discourse and the sparseness of our data require that we understand the stylistic connotations of rarer words and expressions which cannot be gleaned directly from our target texts. To this end, we apply methods introduced in our recent work to derive information with regards to six stylistic aspects from a large corpus of texts from Project Gutenberg. We thus build high-coverage, finely grained lexicons that include common multiword collocations. Using this information along with student annotations of two modernist texts, Woolf's To The Lighthouse and Joyce's The Dead, we confirm that free indirect discourse does, at a stylistic level, reflect a mixture of narration and direct speech, and we investigate the extent to which social attributes of the various characters (in particular age, class, and gender) are reflected in their lexical stylistic profile.}

However, prior studies have not clearly dissociated the effects of accurate lexical prediction from other forms of contextual facilitation such as plausibility or semantic priming. In this study, we measured electrophysiological responses to predicted and unpredicted target words in passages providing varying levels of contextual support. This method was used to isolate the neural effects of prediction from other potential contextual influences on lexical processing. While both prediction and discourse context influenced ERP amplitudes within the time range of the N400, the effects of prediction occurred much more rapidly, preceding contextual facilitation by approximately 100. ms. In addition, a frontal, post-N400 positivity (PNP) was modulated by both prediction accuracy and the overall plausibility of the preceding passage. These results suggest a unique temporal primacy for prediction in facilitating lexical access. They also suggest that the frontal PNP may index the costs of revising discourse representations following an incorrect lexical prediction.}

These findings are in conflict with a recent study from Angele, Laishley, Rayner, and Liversedge (2014), in which sentential fit had no early influence on word skipping rates during reading. In the present study, we used a gaze-contingent boundary change paradigm to manipulate the syntactic congruity of an upcoming noun or verb outside of participants' awareness. Across 3 experiments (total N = 148), we observed higher skipping rates for syntactically valid previews ("The admiral would not confess" . . .), when compared with violation previews ("The admiral would not surgeon" . . .). Readers were less likely to skip an ungrammatical continuation, even when that word was repeated within the same sentence ("The admiral would not admiral" . . .), suggesting that word-class constraints can take precedence over lexical repetition effects. To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence for an influence of syntactic context during parafoveal word recognition. On the basis of the early time-course of this effect, we argue that readers can use grammatical constraints to generate syntactic expectations for upcoming words.}

Consensus opinion regarding the continued relevance of this term, what constitutes the hidden curriculum, and the nature of its impact do not exist. Further research is required to contribute to this debate. This work sets out to investigate which factors beyond taught cognitive knowledge influence medical students in clinical and educational environments and examine how this occurs. Semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted with 39 students from one UK medical school. Fourteen faculty were interviewed individually to triangulate data. Data were analysed using constructivist thematic analysis, informed by grounded theory convention. The presence of the hidden curriculum was clearly demonstrated, acting through role modelling, organizational culture, stereotyping and professional dress. Mentioned frequently were the influences of the hidden curriculum on student professionalism and identity development. Professionalism was perceived as being negatively impacted by the hidden curriculum and seen as an imposition from senior faculty to control students. Students believe medical identity formation begins prior to medical school, in a process known as ``anticipatory socialization'', a previously unstudied identity transition. Students felt covert institutional agendas negatively impacted their identity, pushing them further from the identity their institution was encouraging them to acquire. Key messages for educators include the need to explore the hidden curriculum through discussion with students. Improving transparency of organizational culture may allow students to interpret institutional agendas in the way institutions formally intend, reducing orthogonal interpretations of organizational culture and subsequent impact upon identity formation.},

We tackle this information access problem from a geographic information science perspective using a case study exploring a semi-structured historical encyclopedia. We propose a three-pronged approach for this, based around (1) automatic retrieval of spatio-temporal and thematic information from digital text documents; (2) transformation of the extracted information to spatialize and visualize spatio-temporal and thematic structures; and (3) integration of the spatialized displays in an interactive web interface driven by a user-centered design and evaluation approach. We implemented an interactive spatialized network display to allow identification of spatio-temporal relationships hidden in the text archive, complemented by an interactive self-organizing map display to visualize thematic relationships in these text documents. We evaluated the utility and usability of the developed interface in a user study with digital humanities scholars. Empirical results show that the developed interface supports target users in the humanities uncovering latent spatio-temporal and thematic relationships and generated new insights through the spatialized text collection. Adopting this approach, we illustrate one avenue to addressing the information access problem in the digital humanities from a GIScience perspective.},

To gain a deeper understanding of these phenomena, in this work we analyze the lexicons used by the communities of users emerging on Facebook around verified and unverified contents. We show how the lexical approach provides important insights about the kind of information processed by the two communities of users and about their overall sentiment. Furthermore, by focusing on comment threads, we observe a strong positive correlation between the lexical convergence of co-commenters and their number of interactions, which in turns suggests that such a trend could be a proxy for the emergence of collective identities and polarization in opinion dynamics.},

The present study assessed the reliability of this effect across narrative contexts and self-reported variation in levels of engagement during reading. Experiment 1 used an extended sample (N = 263) and replicated an interactive influence of pronouns on perspectives adopted during reading simple action sentences (e.g., "You are peeling the cucumber."), with "You" promoting an agent's perspective, and He promoting an onlooker's external perspective. The magnitude of this effect was partially accounted for by individual differences in the tendency to get actively engaged during reading. Specifically, readers who self-reported greater empathic engagement during reading also showed a higher likelihood to adopt an agent's perspective when sentences used the pronoun "You" or "I." Experiment 2 (N = 217) examined whether these influences of pronouns and individual differences would emerge with relatively realistic, extended narratives; effects were generally less robust than with single sentence scenarios, though empathic engagement still predicted adopting an agent's perspective with the pronoun "You" or "I." Furthermore, even in the absence of perspective modulation in response to pronouns, comprehension was maintained. These results demonstrate that differentially adopting perspectives as a function of pronouns is not universal or necessary for comprehension, but rather influenced by narrative context and individuals' propensity to find themselves immersed in described events. Results are considered within the framework of embodied cognition, representational pluralism, individual differences, and high-powered replication projects.},

  abstract = {Emotion lexicons describe the affective meaning of words and thus constitute a centerpiece for advanced sentiment and emotion analysis. Yet, manually curated lexicons are only available for a handful of languages, leaving most languages of the world without such a precious resource for downstream applications. Even worse, their coverage is often limited both in terms of the lexical units they contain and the emotional variables they feature. In order to break this bottleneck, we here introduce a methodology for creating almost arbitrarily large emotion lexicons for any target language. Our approach requires nothing but a source language emotion lexicon, a bilingual word translation model, and a target language embedding model. Fulfilling these requirements for 91 languages, we are able to generate representationally rich high-coverage lexicons comprising eight emotional variables with more than 100k lexical entries each. We evaluated the automatically generated lexicons against human judgment from 26 datasets, spanning 12 typologically diverse languages, and found that our approach produces results in line with state-of-the-art monolingual approaches to lexicon creation and even surpasses human reliability for some languages and variables.

  abstract = {"Eric Bulson "The novel is sogged with humanity." E.M. Forster I "His studies are not very deep," one character says about another in George Eliot's Middlemarch, "he is only reading a novel." Just imagine if that same critical judgement about novels and novel readers were accurate today! Not only would it be assumed that we all read novels merely to pass the time, but also with the assumption that they don't have much to teach us in the first place. We'd only be reading a novel, and that's it. The real knowledge about life and living, we'd be told, lies elsewhere, maybe in the great epics of bygone ages, intensely private lyric poems, or sweeping dramas where all the world's a stage. The novel, of course, still has its detractors, but no one can deny that this literary genre runs "very deep." Part of that depth comes from the fact that the novel, a term ironically rooted in the Latin word for new (novum), is actually rather old. In fact, by some accounts it goes back 4,000 years to the narrative fictions of ancient Egypt with examples appearing subsequently as far afield as Hellenistic Greece, the histories and romances of medieval China and France, and the subgenres of modern England, Russia, Brazil, Nigeria, Japan, and the United States. And if the forms of the novel are indeed many, they are evidence enough that there has been an ongoing desire across cultures and over millenia to tell fictional stories in prose about life"-- Provided by publisher},

The results reveal the existence of characteristic topic areas for both IS (information retrieval, information seeking behavior, scientometrics) and DH (computational linguistics, distant reading and digital editions) that can be used to distinguish them as disciplines in their own right. However, there is also a larger shared area of practices related to information management and also a few shared topic clusters that indicate a common ground for -- mostly methodological -- exchange between the two disciplines.},

The focus has largely been on the interactions between short-term and long-term regions of memory. Such studies have also on occasion been complemented by behavioural experiments. More recently, a growing body of work has started to emerge from the biological cognitive neurosciences which looks at these same processes with the aid of scanning technologies (e.g. Dehaene 2003, 2009, Ledoux 1998, Eichenbaum 2011). The questions that will be considered in this paper are can these scientific findings be extended to aesthetic objects that are studied in the humanities, and in particular to the style of literary texts, and also can the way literary style figures operate shed light on how the mind and brain might function.},

An introduction to some of the philosophical roots of empathy is followed by tracing its application in contemporary literary theory, in which scholars have pursued empathy with varying degrees of conceptual precision, often within the context of embodied/enactive cognition. The presentation of empirical literary studies of empathy is subsequently contextualized by an overview of psychological and neuroscientific aspects of empathy. Highlighting points of convergence and divergence, the discussion illustrates how findings of empirical literary studies align with recent neuroscientific research. The article concludes with some prospects for future empirical research, suggesting that digitization may contribute to advancing the scientific knowledge of empathy in narrative reading.}

  abstract = {This short methods paper emerges out of the AHRC-funded `Chronotopic Cartographies' project for the digital mapping of place and space as represented in works of literature. The primary aim of that project was to find a way of mapping and visualizing represented literary worlds for which there is no corresponding real `ground'. A solution was found in the form of topological graphs which allow for relative rather than absolute mapping (but also permit a relative imaginary map to be lain on top of a pre-existing cartesian form). Using a spatial schema to chunk out the text in terms of chronotopic (time-space) zones enables the generation of a series of visualizations that show different kinds of spatio-temporal constructions in texts. The visualizations are centred upon nodes that consist of chronotopes (e.g. `the road') as well as locations (e.g. `road to Geneva'); connections between them of different kinds and toporefs within them (references to other places from this one). The paper will articulate core methods from the project, outlining the stages involved in the process, from marking up the text, using a custom-made schema, through graph generation and into the implications for analysis. This will be illustrated in relation to two Victorian texts: the realist space of Dickens's Oliver Twist; and the abstract poetic space of Browning's `Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came'.}

  abstract = {This article offers a theoretical framework to explain circumstances under which perceptions of ``unrealness'' affect engagement in narratives and subsequent perceived realism judgments. A mental models approach to narrative processing forms the foundation of a model that integrates narrative comprehension and phenomenological experiences such as transportation and identification. Three types of unrealness are discussed: fictionality, external realism (match with external reality), and narrative realism (coherence within a story). We gather evidence that fictionality does not affect narrative processing. On the other hand, violations of external and narrative realism are conceived as inconsistencies among the viewer's mental structures as they construct mental models of meaning to represent and comprehend the narrative. These inconsistencies may result in negative online evaluations of a narrative's realism, may disrupt engagement, and may negatively influence postexposure (reflective) realism judgments as well as lessen a narrative's persuasive power.}

The nature of emotional phenomena like reading and writing can be interpreted in different ways and represented with different computational models. Affective computing (AC) researchers often use a categorical model in which text data are associated with emotional labels. We introduce a new way of using normative databases as a way of processing text with a dimensional model and compare it with different categorical approaches. The approach is evaluated using four data sets of texts reflecting different emotional phenomena. An emotional thesaurus and a bag-of-words model are used to generate vectors for each pseudo-document, then for the categorical models three dimensionality reduction techniques are evaluated: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). For the dimensional model a normative database is used to produce three-dimensional vectors (valence, arousal, dominance) for each pseudo-document. This three-dimensional model can be used to generate psychologically driven visualizations. Both models can be used for affect detection based on distances amongst categories and pseudo-documents. Experiments show that the categorical model using NMF and the dimensional model tend to perform best.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Broadly speaking, this chapter is about reconstruction by the comparative method. More precisely, it concerns the regularity of sound change, that cornerstone which underlies our ability to recover linguistic history by the comparative method. Specifically, I examine the question ``Is sound change regular ?,'' addressing in particular some of the more sociocultural aspects of the issue. I discuss seven topics which have at times been presented as challenges to the hypothesis that sound change is regular: sound symbolism, onomatopoeia and affective/expressive symbolism, avoidance of homophony, morphologically conditioned phonological changes, areal linguistic borrowing, language death, and questions concerning the nature of change in so-called exotic speech communities. To anticipate the conclusion, I argue that these do not, in fact, present true exceptions to the regularity of sound change, but that it is important to take these issues into account in order to attain a full understanding of sound change in particular and of linguistic change in general.},

  abstract = {This study addresses a significant gap in our understanding of self-representation in historical news media reporting. It focusses on one significant historical publication: the first nationally distributed Indigenous Australian newspaper written and edited by First Nations people\,--\,The Australian Abo Call: The Voice of the Aborigines (hereafter The AAC). The AAC was published in six editions in 1938, the year of the 150th anniversary of invasion of the continent now known as Australia. The corpus consists of all (non-fiction) articles from all six editions of this newspaper, which was founded, edited and largely written by Yorta Yorta man J.T. (Jack) Patten. As such, the study offers a synchronic `snapshot' of a particular moment in Australian history. The study uses corpus-assisted discourse analysis to explore the linguistic construction of self-representation\,--\,how First Nations people write about themselves and the communities they represent. I~proceed from inductively identifying group-based identity labels to categorising these labels in terms of their positionality in relation to `self' and `other'. Using concordances, the study also qualitatively examines these identity labels through transitivity analysis. The results suggest that The AAC was a site of political awakening directed at both Indigenous and white Australians, calling on the former to mobilise, on the latter to listen, and on both to act. The analysis also shows that this activism sits very much within the dominant Western/Colonial frame, reflecting the historical settler-colonial context of the period in which this newspaper was published. The study has broader implications for corpus-assisted discourse analysis, by indicating the insights we gain by shifting our gaze away from `other'-representation in mainstream newspapers towards `self'-representation in community-led publications.},

Eye movements were tracked and compared in ten musicians undergoing Bachelor's degrees as they silently read six texts and six pieces of music for piano: the music was contemporary, in modal style, and the style of the texts was informative and literary. Participants were music students at Universidad de Chile studying for Bachelor's degrees. Information integration for both local (intrasentence/phrase) and global (intersentence/phrase) levels of processing was assessed through regressive fixations at the first pass and re-reading stages. Memory involvement in musical and verbal processing was investigated using verbal working memory and spatial memory tasks, suggesting a link between spatial memory and the reading of contemporary music. Both local and global integrative controls vary according to the reading stages, with differences between music styles and text types. These differences relate to information intake and integrative reading mechanisms. Despite the fact that musicians used different strategies for processing verbal and musical information, no cross-patterns of individual reading strategies were observed between conditions. Although the underlying processes are different, resource-sharing between the two domains cannot be ruled out.},

Since reader-response theory stresses the synthesis between reader and text, so it is proposed that practical applications should be based on this interaction. Students make notes in their reading logs as they read a novel, setting down their thoughts and feelings. This encourages them to interact with the text, and to tap into their individual responses to the literature. While reading logs are already used in L1 literature teaching, this article argues that the activity is particularly appropriate for L2 use, since it stimulates foreign language readers to go beyond the first barrier of semantic understanding and to move towards critical appreciation. The article describes how reading logs were successfully used in literature classes at a junior college in Taiwan.}

However, Hsiao and Gibson (2003) report an OR preference for Chinese, a finding that has been contested. Here we report faster OR versus SR processing in Basque, an ergative, head-final language with pre-nominal relative clauses. A self-paced reading task was used in Experiments 1 and 2, while ERPs were recorded in Experiment 3. We used relative clauses that were ambiguous between an object or subject-gap interpretation and disambiguated later in the sentence. The results of Experiments 1 and 2 showed that SR took longer to read than OR in the critical disam-biguating region. In addition, Experiment 3 showed that SR produced larger amplitudes than OR in the P600 window immediately after reading the critical disambiguating word. Our results suggest that SR are not universally easier to process. They cast doubts on uni-versal hypotheses and suggest that processing complexity may depend on language-spe-cific aspects of grammar.},

Experimental findings further show that brief exposure to literary, but not popular fiction, boosts performance on Theory of Mind. These results are interpreted as stemming from the greater complexity of the characters and plots of literary fiction; a claim that is consistent with evidence that readers view literary fiction characters as more complex than popular fiction characters. Here we focus on style, and test whether said differential complexity finds a parallel in the language of these two types of fiction. Results of Natural Language Processing analyses on a corpus of literary and popular fiction texts confirm that literary fiction has greater lexical and syntax complexity than popular fiction.},

  abstract = {This study presents an experiment that uses reading times as a measure of the processing effort demanded by ?difficult? poems, where difficulty is defined as a text-driven response phenomenon associated with resistance to reading fluency. Reading times have been used before to explore the processing of literature, but seldom with the aim of shedding light on difficulty. There is then scope to redress this research gap, also in light of Shklovsky?s claim that the technique of art is ?to increase the difficulty and length of perception?. In the current experiment, a group of participants read six poems on-screen. The poems are by Mark Strand, Ezra Pound, Wallace Stevens, Geoffrey Hill, Susan Howe and Jeremy Prynne, and have been selected based on critics? remarks on their difficulty or lack thereof. An extract from a novel by JG Ballard was also included to find out how its narrativity would compare, in processing terms, to the more elliptical narrativity of Strand?s and Pound?s poems. The time spent on each line was recorded by software E-Prime, commonly used in psycholinguistics. The results indicate that three of these texts ? Ballard?s, Strand?s and Pound?s ? were read at a much higher speed than non-narrative poems by Stevens, Hill, Prynne and Howe. The proposed explanation was that it is sufficient for readers to recognize traces of a narrative schema to read the text fluently, even if such text is low in coherence. By contrast, when prototypical narrative features cannot be mapped onto a text, the processing effort as measured by reading times remarkably increases. Overall, the results refine our understanding of the relationship between difficulty and the stylistic strategies associated with it.}

For example, an analogy with the Cinderella story may be made in describing the unexpected success of an underdog in seemingly different stories. We present a new task and dataset for story understanding: identifying instances of similar narratives from a collection of narrative texts. We present an initial approach for this problem, which finds correspondences between narratives in terms of plot events, and resemblances between characters and their social relationships. Our approach yields an 8\% absolute improvement in performance over a competitive information-retrieval baseline on a novel dataset of plot summaries of 577 movie remakes from Wikipedia.}

Among many areas where multimodal research is being conducted, the field of semiotics is notable for its major contributions to the study of multimodality. Although mainly focused on written discourse rather than spoken, scholarly works in semiotics have established a theory of multimodality and multimodal communication that can be applied to the analysis of various multimodal discourses. Drawing on ethnographic data and video recordings of two German women, S. Norris proposes and illustrates a new theoretical and methodological framework of multimodal action analysis, and shows how it can be used to investigate identity. Much of the multimodal research in conversation analysis draws on data from institutional settings so as to explore routinised practices in various workplace settings. A gesture study is a vast field that encompasses a diversity of research domains across different disciplines whose analysis of spoken discourse focuses on speech and gesture.},

We report the results of an eye tracking experiment that used the gaze-contingent moving window technique to examine individual differences in the size of readers' perceptual span. Participants read paragraphs while the size of the rightward window of visible text was systematically manipulated across trials. In addition, participants completed a large battery of individual-difference measures representing two cognitive constructs: language ability and oculomotor processing speed. Results showed that higher scores on language ability measures and faster oculomotor processing speed were associated with faster reading times and shorter fixation durations. More interestingly, the size of readers' perceptual span was modulated by individual differences in language ability but not by individual differences in oculomotor processing speed, suggesting that readers with greater language proficiency are more likely to have efficient mechanisms to extract linguistic information beyond the fixated word.}

We outline a number of ways in which an AI DH curriculum offers concrete and impactful responses to these many crises. AI DH yields meaningful new avenues of research for the humanities and the humanistic social sciences, and offers new ways that higher education can better prepare students for the world into which they graduate. DEI metrics show how an AI DH curriculum can engage students traditionally underserved by conventional STEM courses. Finally, AI DH educates all students for civic engagement in order to address both the social and economic impacts of emerging AI technologies. This article provides an overview of an AI DH curriculum, the motivating theory behind design decisions, and a detailed look into two sample courses.},

They bring a degree of understanding and fluidity far surpassing previous language models, and they are rapidly progressing. They excel at representing and interpreting ideas and experiences that involve complex and subtle language and are therefore ideal for Computational Digital Humanities research. This paper briefly surveys how XAI can be used to augment two Computational Digital Humanities research areas relying on LLMs: (a) diachronic text sentiment analysis and (b) narrative generation. We also introduce a novel XAI greybox ensemble for diachronic sentiment analysis generalizable to any AI classification data points within a structured time series. Under human-in-the-loop supervision (HITL), this greybox ensemble combines the high performance of SOTA blackbox models like gpt-4--0613 with the interpretability, efficiency, and privacy-preserving nature of whitebox models. Two new local (EPC) and global (ECC) metrics enable multi-scale XAI at both the local and global levels. This greybox ensemble framework extends the SentimentArcs framework with OpenAI's latest GPT models, new metrics and a modified supervisory HITL workflow released as open source software at https://github.com/jon-chun/SentimentArcs-Greybox.}

Despite these far-reaching outcomes, Digital Humanities still does not have a satisfactory influence in the traditional disciplinary fields. We need to find new methods to deal with cultural artifacts and texts. Amongst the many emerging research fields in the DH, two come forth as the most promising and interesting: Big Data and distant reading; Semantic Web and Linked Open Data. In my paper I will argue that Big Data in the Humanities, although very promising, have some critical issues, and I will propose the idea of a Semantic Cultural and Literary Web, a collaborative infrastructure based on ontology driven semantic annotation of primary resources.},

Building on the semiotic and structuralist narratology, and on the work carried out in the late 1980s by Giuseppe Gigliozzi in Italy, the focus of my research are the concepts of character and of narrative world/space. This formal model is expressed in the OWL 2 ontology language. The main reason to adopt a formal modeling approach is that I consider the purely probabilistic-quantitative methods (now widespread in digital literary studies) inadequate. An ontology, on one hand provides a tool for the analysis of strictly literary texts. On the other hand (though beyond the scope of the present work), its formalization can also represent a significant contribution towards grounding the application of storytelling methods outside of scholarly contexts.DOI:~http://dx.doi.org/10.14195/2182-8830\_4-1\_2}

By departing from a contextualized take of the term digital coupled with humanities and palaeography, I will show how digital approaches relate to the scholarly tradition of the study of handwriting and writing systems as a whole and how recent approaches of digital palaeography can be defined as critical, self-reflective, multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary. Moving between a formal and a historically situated analysis, I will relate practices of modelling of handwriting in digital palaeography to modelling in digital humanities more generally. Digital palaeography will emerge well positioned to represent the complexity of handwritten objects from the unfamiliar perspective of the substance of the expression of handwriting (text as shape).}

The third part of the introduction presents the scope of the project ''Modelling between digital and humanities: Thinking in practice''. The aim of a project workshop held in 2017, of which this volume collects the proceedings, was to present a multitude of modelling practices from various disciplines together with different theoretical frameworks.

Word recognition processes seem to be reflected quite straightforwardly in the eye movement record. In contrast, eye movements seem to reflect sentence comprehension processes in a more varied fashion. This chapter reviews the major word identification factors that affect eye movements and describe the role these eye movement phenomena have played in developing theories of eye movements in reading. The chapter tabulates and summarizes 100 reports of how syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and world-knowledge factors affect eye movements during reading in an initial attempt to identify order in how different types of challenges to comprehension are reflected in eye movements. The chapter reviews findings that have demonstrated effects due to (1) word frequency, (2) word familiarity, (3) age-of-acquisition, (4) number of meanings, (5) morphology, (6) contextual constraint, and (7) plausibility.},

From there we proceed to lexical processing, where we summarize Rayner's work on effects of word frequency, length, predictability, and the resolution of lexical ambiguity. Next, we turn to syntactic and discourse processing, covering the well-known garden-path model of parsing and briefly reviewing studies of pronoun resolution and inferencing. The next section shifts from language to visual cognition and reviews research which makes use of eye movement techniques to investigate object and scene processing. Next, we summarize Rayner and colleagues' approach to computational modeling, with a description of the E-Z Reader model linking attention and lexical processing to eye movement control. The final section discusses the issues Rayner and his colleagues were focused on most recently and considers how Rayner's legacy will continue into the future.},

  abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;The development of students with a formal curriculum should be in balance with the social and cultural aspects of any school, which in this place is the second curriculum or hidden curriculum so as to ensure a holistic development of students. The study sought to explore the positive impact of classroom assessment on students' resilience as a hidden curriculum. Students of University of Education, Winneba were targeted out of which 150 undergraduate students were randomly selected for the study participants. Three instruments were used. They were the unidimensional school assessment perception scale developed by Fisher, Waldrip and Dorman, Resilience scale by Campbell-Sills and Stein and the Self-Regulated learning scale by Tan et al., were adapted and used for the measurement of the constructs of relevance in the study. Data on the two hypotheses were tested using Covariance-Based Structural Equation Modelling (CB-SEM) method with bias corrected confidence intervals. The finding of the study revealed that assessment was a significant predictor of self-regulated learning and resilience. \&amp;nbsp;It was recommended among others that Faculty members are encouraged to strengthen classroom formative assessment practices and not to dwell on only summative assessment to take classroom related decisions. \&amp;nbsp;The implication of this is that it will create dynamic assessment culture that consolidate both the formal and the positive hidden curriculum benefits.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

Information about entities and their relation to each other is often crucial for historical research. However, most text mining tools provide only very basic support for dealing with entities, typically at most including facilities for entity tagging. Historians, on the other hand, are typically interested in the relations between entities and the contexts in which these are mentioned. In this paper, we focus on person entities. We provide an overview of the tool and describe how person-centric mining can be integrated in a general-purpose text mining environment. We also discuss our approach for automatically extracting person networks from newspaper archives, which includes a novel method for person name disambiguation, which is particularly suited for the newspaper domain and obtains state-of-the-art disambiguation results.},

Importantly, eye-tracking has significant advantages over traditional online processing measures: chiefly that it allows for more `natural' processing as it does not require a secondary task, and that it provides a very rich moment-to-moment data source. In recognition of the technology's benefits, an ever increasing number of researchers in applied linguistics and second language research are beginning to use it. As eye-tracking gains traction in the field, it is important to ensure that it is established in an empirically sound fashion. To do this it is important for the field to come to an understanding about what eye-tracking is, what eye-tracking measures tell us, what it can be used for, and what different eye-tracking systems can and cannot do. Further, it is important to establish guidelines for designing sound research studies using the technology. The goal of the current review is to begin to address thes...},

This study expanded on previous work by using an inconsistency paradigm to investigate the effects of protagonist association on object accessibility. Readers experienced more processing difficulty when a target sentence contradicted previously presented information about protagonist- associated objects than when the contradiction pertained to protagonist-dissociated objects. However, the results of a naming time study demonstrated that this effect was due to increases in accessibility of protagonist-associated objects, not continued increases in availability. A final experiment demonstrated that degree of association between the object and the protagonist does not influence object accessibility. The re- sults provide additional evidence for, and a more refined explanation of, foreground- ing effects during reading.}

For example, public misconceptions about climate change can lead to lowered acceptance of the reality of climate change and lowered support for mitigation policies. This study experimentally explored the impact of misinformation about climate change and tested several pre-emptive interventions designed to reduce the influence of misinformation. We found that false-balance media coverage (giving contrarian views equal voice with climate scientists) lowered perceived consensus overall, although the effect was greater among free-market supporters. Likewise, misinformation that confuses people about the level of scientific agreement regarding anthropogenic global warming (AGW) had a polarizing effect, with free-market supporters reducing their acceptance of AGW and those with low free-market support increasing their acceptance of AGW. However, we found that inoculating messages that (1) explain the flawed argumentation technique used in the misinformation or that (2) highlight the scientific consensus on climate change were effective in neutralizing those adverse effects of misinformation. We recommend that climate communication messages should take into account ways in which scientific content can be distorted, and include pre-emptive inoculation messages.}

Additional facilitation for identical cognates was found for later eye movement measures. This shows that the complex, semantic context of a novel does not eliminate cross-lingual activation in natural reading. In L1 we detected non-identical cognate facilitation for first fixation durations of longer nouns. Identical cognate facilitation was found on total reading times for high frequent nouns. This study is the first to show cognate facilitation in L1 reading of narrative text. This shows that even when reading a novel in the mother tongue, lexical access is not restricted to the target language.},

This large eyetracking corpus is perfectly suited for both exploratory purposes and more directed hypothesis testing, and it can guide the formulation of ideas and theories about naturalistic reading processes in a meaningful context.

Findings               Findings suggest that staff and student images more strongly encapsulated tensions between humans and nature than website photos, but that the latter included more evidence of social sustainability.

  abstract = {In this provocative, consequential book, Couldry and Mejias theorize the dynamics of change in contemporary capitalism as grounded in a new form of data colonialism. They conceptualize the distinctive nature of data colonialism as appropriating myriad aspects of human life as the raw material for capitalism. Data colonialism thus extends the process of commodification into new spheres of social life. This includes all areas of social activity where data are appropriated for profit; they range from work to education, health care, economic transactions, and social media. As we engage in these diverse activities, corporations treat these various kinds of data as ```just there', freely available for extraction and the release of its potential for humankind'' (Couldry and Mejias 2019, 9). Such corporate appropriation of contemporary data is similar to historical claims to land as belonging to no one under earlier forms of colonialism. In developing this argument, the authors draw persuasively on a 2011 World Economic Forum report that refers to personal data as a resource as valuable as oil, because of its ability to fuel economic processes. They delineate intriguing parallels between historical processes of colonial expansion by taking over land and other natural resources and contemporary processes of mining personal data as inputs for capitalism.}

Critical studies over the past century have pointed to the multifaceted nature of identity, with a number of different theories and approaches used to explain how everyday people have a sense of themselves, their behaviors, desires, and representations. In the era of interactive, digital, and networked media and communication, identity can be understood as even more complex, with digital users arguably playing a more extensive role in fashioning their own self-representations online, as well as making use of the capacity to co-create common and group narratives of identity through interactivity and the proliferation of audio-visual user-generated content online},

  abstract = {IntroductionThis chapter considers the importance of feedback to students in higher education (HE). It discusses the notion of the hidden curriculum as a context for critiquing how feedback to students can work in a complex and unstable UK HE sector. The chapter then looks at an intervention to help (particularly first-generation) students develop their understandings of feedback and work towards supporting their confidence, self-esteem and academic development.Written feedback to students is often a private `exchange' constructed by lecturers working their way through hundreds of scripts as quickly as possible. There is evidence of a growing and significant degree of student dissatisfaction with feedback as a meaningful and supportive learning process in HE, to which I will return later. Because it is often assumed that feedback is a straightforward `common-sense' transmission process, the complexity of feedback as a vital part of learning and teaching has been undermined by other institutional discourses. This is where the notion of the hidden curriculum becomes useful, and some historical context helps to develop the significance of the phrase to feedback discourses.The hidden curriculum is a well-used but highly ambiguous phrase, subject to a range of uses and interpretations. Most writers agree that the term was first used in the context of compulsory schooling by Philip Jackson (1990 [1968]) who seems to have introduced the phrase in his important text, Life in Classrooms; although John Dewey's (1963 [1938]) notion of `collateral learning' also came close to this idea. Jackson identifies three key characteristics of school life that are `not immediately visible' but are as `important as those that are' (Jackson, 1990 [1968], p 10). He chooses `crowds', `praise' and `power' (Jackson, 1990 [1968], pp 10--11) and after analysing these as key aspects of the hidden curriculum he comments:the crowds, the praise, and the power that combine to give a distinctive flavour to classroom life collectively form a hidden curriculum which each student (and teacher) must master if he is to make his way satisfactorily through the school. The demands created by these features of classroom life may be contrasted with the `academic' demands -- the official curriculum so to speak -- to which educators traditionally have paid the most attention.

  abstract = {What is the nature of place, and how does one undertake to write about it? To answer these questions, geographer and poet Tim Cresswell looks to Chicago's iconic Maxwell Street Market area. Maxwell Street was for decades a place where people from all corners of the city mingled to buy and sell goods, play and listen to the blues, and encounter new foods and cultures. Now, redeveloped and renamed University Village, it could hardly be more different. In Maxwell Street, Cresswell advocates approaching the study of place as an "assemblage" of things, meanings, and practices. He models this innovative approach through a montage format that exposes the different types of texts--primary, secondary, and photographic sources--that have attempted to capture the essence of the area. Cresswell studies his historical sources just as he explores the different elements of Maxwell Street--exposing them layer by layer. Brilliantly interweaving words and images, Maxwell Street sheds light on a historic Chicago neighborhood and offers a new model for how to write about place that will interest anyone in the fields of geography, urban studies, or cultural history. -- {\ddag}c From publisher's description},

And how has our DH praxis evolved through interactions with our students? This timely volume explores how DH is taught and what that reveals about the field of DH. While institutions are formally integrating DH into the curriculum and granting degrees, many instructors are still almost as new to DH as their students. As colleagues continue to ask what digital humanities {$<$}em{$>$}is,{$<$}/em{$>$} we have the opportunity to answer them in terms of {$<$}em{$>$}how we teach{$<$}/em{$>$} DH. The contributors to {$<$}em{$>$}What We Teach When We Teach DH{$<$}/em{$>$} represent a wide range of disciplines, including literary and cultural studies, history, art history, philosophy, and library science. Their essays are organized around four critical topics at the heart of DH pedagogy: teachers, students, classrooms, and collaborations. This book highlights how DH can transform learning across a vast array of curricular structures, institutions, and education levels, from high schools and small liberal arts colleges to research-intensive institutions and postgraduate professional development programs.

Woolf employs frequent shifts in point of view in her texts, the result of which is that different characters' streams of consciousness are interwoven together. This narrative design allows the text to probe into the relationship between different minds. Drawing on findings in discourse analysis, this article demonstrates that the way in which characters' viewpoints are juxtaposed resembles paired actions in conversation and that the intersubjectivity underlying the format of adjacency pairs is also mapped on the juxtaposition of different minds. It thereby argues that this sequencing format functions as an effective linguistic mechanism for rendering the social interactive quality of consciousness in Woolf's narrative.},

While the frequent viewpoint shifts in Woolf?s novels have been noted by critics and literary linguists, only a limited amount of research has been conducted to examine how ?ordinary readers?, that is, readers without much literary or linguistic training, respond to this stylistic feature. In order to gain a better understanding of this issue, the current study combines qualitative and quantitative approaches in the investigation. The main experiment material is a passage from To the Lighthouse, in which the narrative viewpoint shifts between two characters. For the purpose of comparison, another three passages containing a consistent narrative point of view were also selected. A re-reading task was set up: in the first reading, participants read for general comprehension, and in the second reading, they were asked to identify whose point(s) of view each passage is narrated from. After assigning narrative point of view to the four passages, participants were instructed to rate each passage between 1 and 6 both in terms of difficulty in comprehension and in terms of difficulty in viewpoint attribution. Results obtained from this study show that a significant number of participants identified shifts in point of view and that this narrative phenomenon tends to require more reading time and processing effort.}

One example of interference comes from illusions of grammaticality, where ungrammatical sentences are perceived as grammatical (e.g. `the key to the cabinets were rusty'). While such effects indicate interference influences perception of sentence grammaticality, less is known about how interference influences the semantic interpretation assigned to a sentence. We report two reading experiments that manipulated sentence plausibility, rather than grammaticality, as a diagnostic of interference. In both experiments, although reading times were longer for implausible sentences, this plausibility effect was reliably attenuated when a distractor item partially matched the cues at retrieval. We interpret these results as being compatible with the predictions of cue-based parsing. The illusions of plausibility that we report indicate that similarity-based retrieval interference has a potent influence on the semantic interpretation that is assigned to a sentence during processing.},

  abstract = {The analysis of literary works has experienced a surge in computer-assisted processing. To obtain insights into the community structures and social interactions portrayed in novels, the creation of social networks from novels has gained popularity. Many methods rely on identifying named entities and relations for the construction of these networks, but many of these tools are not specifically created for the literary domain. Furthermore, many of the studies on information extraction from literature typically focus on 19th and early 20th century source material. Because of this, it is unclear if these techniques are as suitable to modern-day literature as they are to those older novels. We present a study in which we evaluate natural language processing tools for the automatic extraction of social networks from novels as well as their network structure. We find that there are no significant differences between old and modern novels but that both are subject to a large amount of variance. Furthermore, we identify several issues that complicate named entity recognition in our set of novels and we present methods to remedy these. We see this work as a step in creating more culturally-aware AI systems.},

Cognitive processing was assessed using cued retrospective reporting, whereas comprehension and transfer tests measured the quality of the constructed representation. Within the framework of Cognitive Load Theory, visual cues highlighting the subsystems of the heart were hypothesized to guide attention, reduce visual search and extraneous cognitive load, and enhance learning. As predicted, learners looked more often and longer at cued parts. However, we found no effects of cueing on visual search and cognitive load. With respect to cognitive processing, performance differences were found on the number of statements in the learners' verbal reports. These findings suggest that visual cueing can guide attention in an animation, but other factors are also important in determining the effectiveness of visual cues on learning.},

In two experiments, two groups of participants viewed the same single emotional and neutral words while carrying out different tasks. In both experiments, valence (pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral) was fully crossed with arousal (high and low). We found that the task made a substantial contribution to how valence and arousal modulated the late positive complex (LPC), which is thought to reflect sustained evaluative processing (particularly of emotional stimuli). When participants performed a semantic categorization task in which emotion was not directly relevant to task performance, the LPC showed a larger amplitude for high-arousal than for low-arousal words, but no effect of valence. In contrast, when participants performed an overt valence categorization task, the LPC showed a large effect of valence (with unpleasant words eliciting the largest positivity), but no effect of arousal. These data show not only that valence and arousal act independently to influence word processing, but that their relative contributions to prolonged evaluative neural processes are strongly influenced by the situational demands (and by individual differences, as revealed in a subsequent analysis of subjective judgments).}

  abstract = {Nowadays users get informed and shape their opinion through social media. However, the disintermediated access to contents does not guarantee quality of information. Selective exposure and confirmation bias, indeed, have been shown to play a pivotal role in content consumption and information spreading. Users tend to select information adhering (and reinforcing) their worldview and to ignore dissenting information. This pattern elicits the formation of polarized groups -- i.e., echo chambers -- where the interaction with like-minded people might even reinforce polarization. In this work we address news consumption around Brexit in UK on Facebook. In particular, we perform a massive analysis on more than 1 Million users interacting with Brexit related posts from the main news providers between January and July 2016. We show that consumption patterns elicit the emergence of two distinct communities of news outlets. Furthermore, to better characterize inner group dynamics, we introduce a new technique which combines automatic topic extraction and sentiment analysis. We compare how the same topics are presented on posts and the related emotional response on comments finding significant differences in both echo chambers and that polarization influences the perception of topics. Our results provide important insights about the determinants of polarization and evolution of core narratives on online debating.},

The current study investigates direct and cumulative effects of reading literature on ToM using confirmatory Bayesian analyses. Direct effects were assessed by comparing the ToM skills of participants who read texts that were manipulated to differ in the amount of gap filling they required. Cumulative effects were assessed by considering the relationship between lifetime literary fiction exposure and ToM. Results showed no evidence for direct effects of reading literature on ToM. However, lifetime literary fiction exposure was associated with higher ToM, particularly cognitive ToM. Although reading a specific piece of literary fiction may thus not have immediately measurable effects on ToM, lifetime exposure to this fiction type is associated with more advanced ToM.}

As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

Due to the recent scholarly attention to these journalistic outlets, some authors have pointed to diverse critics such as the political bias and the low impact of fact-checking initiatives. In line with the research approaching the weaponization of disinformation in politics, this chapter reflects on the instrumentalization of verifying practices as a fact to consider when studying fact-checking. The investigation applies a combined methodology to compare Bendita and Maldita initiatives. While the latter is internationally recognized as an entity of fact-checking, the second one arises as an imitation of it and lacks recognition and scholarly attention. Conclusions suggest that fact-checking implies more complex activities than refuting specific facts, while alt-right positions can instrumentalize fact-checking for political objectives. The authors call for the importance of definitions that exclude this type of misuse of verification.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Teachers' belief systems about the inclusion of students with special needs may explain gaps between policy and practice. We investigated three inter-related aspects of teachers' belief systems: teachers' cognitive appraisals (e.g., attitudes), emotional appraisal (e.g., feelings), and self-efficacy (e.g., agency to teach inclusive classrooms). To date, research in this field has produced contradictory findings, resulting in a sparse understanding of why teachers differ in their belief systems about inclusive education, and how teachers' training experiences contribute to their development of professional beliefs. We used meta-analysis to describe the level and range of teachers' beliefs about inclusive education, and examine factors that contribute to variation in teachers' beliefs, namely (1) the point in teachers' career (pre-service versus in-service), (2) training in special versus regular education, and (3) the effects of specific programs and interventions. We reviewed 102 papers (2000--2020) resulting in 191 effect sizes based on research with 40,898 teachers in 40 countries. On average, teachers' cognitive appraisals, emotional appraisals, and efficacy about inclusion were found to be in the mid-range of scales, indicating room for growth. Self-efficacy beliefs were higher for preservice (               M               \,=\,3.69) than for in-service teachers (               M               \,=\,3.13). Teachers with special education training held more positive views about inclusion than regular education teachers (               d               \,=\,0.41). Training and interventions related to improved cognitive appraisal (               d               \,=\,0.63), emotional appraisal (               d               \,=\,0.63), and self-efficacy toward inclusive practices (               d               \,=\,0.93). The training was particularly effective in encouraging reflection of beliefs and, eventually, facilitating belief change when teachers gained practical experience in inclusive classrooms.

  abstract = {In the present editorial, we briefly describe some aspects of the domain of the scientific study of literature, the methods that have been used, and the nature of the theories that have been developed. We discuss some of the prior work that has been done on cognitive processing of and affective reactions to literary texts and how this interacts with the nature of the reader. We note that there is a need for further work on how the literary reactions vary with the reading context. We also describe some of the methods that have commonly been used, such as reading time, questionnaire responses, and protocol analysis. The potential for applying methods from cognitive neuroscience, such as the measurement of event-related potentials and brain imaging, is an exciting opportunity in the future. Finally, we identify some of the types of explanations that have been developed in the scientific study of literature, including variable relations and processing accounts. Other kinds of theoretical approaches, such as those based on complexity theory, might be needed in the future. Our conclusion is that although a great amount of further work needs to be done in understanding literature, there are a wide range of exciting possibilities.},

  abstract = {An experiment was run to determine the effect of critical reviews on readers' evaluation of literary works. We hypothesized that there are two mechanisms by which extratextual information can have an effect on evaluation: orienting, in which processing is directed to different aspects of the text by the extratextual information, and adjustment, in which the summary evaluation is changed based on how others have evaluated the work. Subjects either read a review of a work and then an excerpt from that work or first read the excerpt and then the review. In both experiments, the review had a substantial impact on reader evaluations, showing that readers combined textual and the extratextual, critical review information to form an evaluation of a literary work. However, when the review was read prior to the excerpt, this effect was mediated by the source of the review: the effect was found only for an expert source. In contrast, when the review was read after the excerpt, a larger effect was found for a peer source. Based on this differential effect, we suggest that expert pre-excerpt reviews orient readers to consider certain classes of information, while peer post-excerpt reviews lead readers to adjust their evaluation.},

  abstract = {This chapter takes up several important theoretical problems and complexities introduced by text mining and datafication to historiography and historical research in order to think about the problems and promises of a digital historicism. The chapter argues for an approach that takes the historicity of the digitized archive seriously without reducing the use of computational methods to either those framed strictly by the terms and language of the present or to a form of rigid historicism that would require enclosing the archive in synchronically constructed interpretive framework. Many of the approaches used within text mining deploy secondary archives---dictionaries, thesauruses, and other forms of human-constructed schemata---that have tended to capture categories used in the present. The chapter concludes by examining the methods and practice of extracting and analyzing emotional or affective content in texts through what is called sentiment mining. Functioning as a case study, sentiment mining demonstrates the need for quantitative and computational humanists to give more attention to the historical dimensions of both text and affect, to both primary and secondary digital sources.},

  abstract = {This chapter serves as an introduction to the problems raised by the use of computational methods in cultural and literary criticism. It does so by placing the desire for a science of reading expressed by many digital humanists within a larger genealogy of interpretive hermeneutics by turning to a series of crucial historical inflection points in which scholars and other intellectuals have raised the question of whether literary and cultural criticism could be a science or should depend upon the procedures of the sciences. While some critics (Matthew Jockers, Ted Underwood, and Andrew Goldstone, among others) have proposed that research in the digital humanities should look more like the quantitative social sciences, this chapter's reconstruction of pivotal debates in the literary studies demonstrates the existence of surplus questions related to the ongoing meaning of cultural objects, textual sources, and archives that remain unaddressable and unanswerable by empirical methods. The chapter argues that what sustains the possibility of this notion of the ``unaddressable'' is a regular disciplinary injunction to apply a critical gaze backward through scholarly methods, to the ways in which evidence is found, collected, or produced, to the ways in which scholars frame this evidence, the protocols by which they interpret it, and the arguments they present to their readers.},

Media Visualization has been chosen as corpus because of its metavisual operation (images are visualized and analyzed by images) and its innovating way of conceiving analysis: by visual instruments. In this paper semiotics is used as an approach to Media Visualization and taken as an object of study as well, especially visual semiotics. In this sense, a comparison between visual semiotics (close reading of small corpora) and quantitative analyses of images (distant reading of vast collections) are conducted from a semiotic point of view. Post-Greimassian semiotics guides this study with respect to the issue of the image-within-an-image and metavisual visualization; Peircean semiotics is employed to explain and develop the notion of diagram.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In this article, we discuss epistemological and methodological aspects of web archive analytics, a recent development towards more data-centred access to web archives. More specifically, we suggest understanding both the process of archiving and subsequent steps of analysis at scale as acts of observation that can be questioned for their epistemological priori. Therefore, we propose the concepts of `blind spots' (features of the live web not included upon creation in the archive) and `silences' (latent features present in the archive but requiring a particular method to be made articulate). In particular, we address two forms of silences playing a structural role in web archive analytics, crucial to both historians and social scientists alike: abundance (or scale) and time. We trace epistemological implications of web archive analytics across an exemplary case study workflow and suggest methodological answers to the issues raised in this process. On the data extraction side, we introduce warc2corpus (w2c), a new tool for extracting granular, structured data, especially temporal information related to the creation, modification, and publication specifically of webpages. For data analysis, we demonstrate how distant reading techniques---more specifically structural topic modelling (STM)---can contribute to providing a rich, temporally structured representation of textual web archive content that in turn can be subjected to scholarly inquiry, interpretation, and re-contextualization.},

Consistent with that hypothesis, there was no effect of the preview manipulation on fixation time on the 1st constituent of the compound, whereas there was on the corresponding letters of the monomorphemic word. There was also a larger preview disruption on gaze duration on the whole monomorphemic word than on the compound, suggesting more parallel processing within monomorphemic words.},

These tools carry with them assumptions of knowledge as observer-independent and certain, rather than observer co-dependent and interpretative. This paper argues that we need a humanities approach to the graphical expression of interpretation. To begin, the concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as capta, taken and constructed. Next, the forms for graphical expression of capta need to be more nuanced to show ambiguity and complexity. Finally, the use of a humanistic approach, rooted in a co-dependent relation between observer and experience, needs to be expressed according to graphics built from interpretative models. In summary: all data have to be understood as capta and the conventions created to express observer-independent models of knowledge need to be radically reworked to express humanistic interpretation.},

The main research methods included testing to identify the level of digital competence, creativity,   and   critical   thinking,   as   well   as   the   interview   to   determine   the   level   of   subject methodological competence.  The results of the study  indicate that the medium  level of the teacher competencies dominates.  The  level  of  teachers'  digital,  subject  methodological,  communicative competencies,  creativity,  and  critical  thinking  decrease  in  persons   with  16-25  years  of  work experience. Digitalization of education most significantly affects the development of communicative and  subject  methodological  competence.  The  relationship  between  digitalization  and  professional competencies  is more significant among teachers with 1-15 years of  work experience.  The obtained results can be used to improve existing educational programmes for teacher training. The prospects for  further  research  include  the  creation  and  verification  of  programmes  of  formative  experiments aimed   at  clarifying   the   causal   relationship   between   the   digitalization   of   education   and   the development of the professional competence of higher school teachers},

  abstract = {Historically media theory has concentrated on a number of areas including communication, media content, style and genre, form, cultural context, target audiences, and political affiliation and other forms of bias of the source content. It therefore also drew on other disciplines such as sociology, psychology, philosophy, literary theory and other relevant disciplines. Initially, it was set in the context of mass communication, because this was the form that the majority of the population had access to in the form of newspapers, books, radio, television, film, public relations, and advertizing. Generally, this was any form of communication where it was one source to many recipients. These different channels of communication could also influence the way the content was perceived because of the history and current social context of each medium. Thus media theory is not a simple matter of just analyzing the content and its form but also includes many other aspects. These are reviewed in this chapter. The transition to a digital environment, and numerous digital forms of media, has changed the environment from one of mass communication to readers and viewers to one where the latter have become some of the primary drivers of the interactions and content generation processes, particularly in areas where such content becomes viral and has had major effects on the social and political environments locally, nationally, and globally. Such transitions are clearly here to stay and are likely to continue. It also reduces the power and influence that traditional media organizations have had in the past. As this is mainly driven by the younger Internet generation it has also increased their significance, influence, and power.},

  abstract = {The term digital humanities has been traditionally used in the context of the application of computing and information technology to the field of the humanities. Typical uses include the digitization of texts and manuscripts and their subsequent analysis, preservation, and archiving. Images can also be scanned for subsequent analysis. Historical site investigations can be scanned for recording and curation purposes. The content of museums and art galleries can be digitized for access by global audiences on the Internet for virtual visits and interactive exploration. In addition, digitized objects and artefacts in the humanities can require new computational tools and methods of analysis, so it can be regarded as a two-way process. Therefore, in some cases there are opportunities for collaborative research projects between the humanities and computer science; between the humanities and digital media; and between the humanities and general science and technology areas. Issues at the interface between the humanities and other disciplines are often productive areas for further research, and can have a transformative effect on the areas involved. It is thus increasingly a partnership between the disciplines with benefits for each. Where the data in the humanities is large and complex, it is able to utilize the latest techniques being developed in the field of Big Data, and also the latest methods for analyzing the data and displaying the results using Visualization and Visual Analytics. Where images and artefacts are involved, the latest techniques in imaging and modeling can also be used. The implementation of these methods can also extend interdisciplinarity in the humanities to a wide variety of areas, with significant potential for advances in knowledge, understanding, and critical enquiry to be made.},

Its conclusions are based upon the evidence base developed within an EU-funded collaboration known as Knowledge Complexity, or KPLEX for short (www.kplex-project.eu), in particular via the project's thirty-eight linked interviews about big data research. When viewed from the perspective of the digital humanities, five distinct points of `aporia' with a significant impact on digital humanities (DH) appear in this corpus, places where the interviewees explicitly or tacitly expose gulfs between the epistemic cultures that contribute to DH and that create tensions between these disciplines, even as they seek to collaborate. This article will explore these areas of apparent irreconcilability, and conclude with a series of reflections on how digital humanities researchers might build upon their unique competency profile to negotiate within these critical conversations, in particular in the framework of the emerging subfield of critical digital humanities.}

Rather than treating maps as a single, unified group, he argues, scholars need to take a processual approach that examines specific types of maps-sea charts versus thematic maps, for example-in the context of the unique circumstances of their production, circulation, and consumption. To illuminate this bold argument, Edney chronicles precisely how the ideal of cartography that has developed in the West since 1800 has gone astray. By exposing the flaws in this ideal, his book challenges everyone who studies maps and mapping practices to reexamine their approach to the topic. The study of cartography will never be the same},

  abstract = {It is often argued that narratives improve social cognition, either by appealing to social-cognitive abilities as we engage with the story world and its characters, or by conveying social knowledge. Empirical studies have found support for both a correlational and a causal link between exposure to (literary, fictional) narratives and social cognition. However, a series of failed replications has cast doubt on the robustness of these claims. Here, we review the existing empirical literature and identify open questions and challenges. An important conclusion of the review is that previous research has given too little consideration to the diversity of narratives, readers, and social-cognitive processes involved in the social-cognitive potential of narratives. We therefore establish a research agenda, proposing that future research should focus on (1) the specific text characteristics that drive the social-cognitive potential of narratives, (2) the individual differences between readers with respect to their sensitivity to this potential, and (3) the various aspects of social cognition that are potentially affected by reading narratives. Our recommendations can guide the design of future studies that will help us understand how, for whom, and in what respect exposure to narratives can advantage social cognition.}

This pioneering book bridges this gap by introducing a conceptual and methodological framework for corpus design and representativeness. Written by experts in the field, it shows how corpora can be designed and built in a way that is both optimally suited to specific research agendas, and adequately representative of the types of language use in question.  It considers questions such as 'what types of texts should be included in the corpus?', and 'how many texts are required?' -- highlighting that the degree of representativeness rests on the dual pillars of domain considerations and distribution considerations. The authors introduce, explain, and illustrate all aspects of this corpus representativeness framework in a step-by-step fashion, using examples and activities to help readers develop practical skills in corpus design and evaluation.},

The enormity of this challenge is reflected in numerous problems plaguing recent studies, from selecting measures without offering a rationale, to interchanging terms that are routinely misconstrued. The Measurement of Affect, Mood, and Emotion cuts through the jargon, clarifies controversies and proposes a sound three-tiered system for selecting measures that can rectify past mistakes and accelerate future progress.

However, network analysis of periodical publications may offer an alternative to the biases of human memory, where one has the tendency to pay attention to a recognizable name, rather than one that has had no historical significance. It thus enables researchers to see connections and a wealth of data that has been obscured by traditional recovery methodologies. Machine reading with network analysis can therefore contribute to an alternate understanding of women's history, one that reinterprets cultural and literary histories that tend to reconstruct gender-based biases. This paper uses network analysis to explore the Fabian News, a late nineteenth-century periodical newsletter produced by the socialist Fabian Society, to recover women activists committed to social and political equality.}

We analyze 203 opinion editorials (``op-eds'') written by 80 different columnists published from 2007 to 2010, a period that saw a number of crucial events and policy proposals regarding climate change. We focus on the key topics the columnists address and the skeptical arguments they employ. The overall results reveal a highly dismissive view of climate change and critical stance toward climate science among these influential conservative pundits. They play a crucial role in amplifying the denial machine's messages to a broad segment of the American public.}

Navigating the hidden curricula of academia is crucial for doctoral trainees, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds. Faculty mentors have an important role in helping trainees uncover and cope with the hidden curriculum. The purpose of this paper is to explore perceptions of the hidden curriculum among diverse doctoral trainees and mentors.                                         Methods:               Following a presentation on the hidden curriculum at the Association for Clinical and Translational Science annual meeting in March 2021, attendees were asked to brainstorm ideas for diverse trainees and their mentors. Breakout room discussions were held for specific hidden curriculum topics; participants voted on which topics to discuss from a list of topics defined during the presentation. Ideas from these discussions were presented to the larger group to upvote.                                         Results:               Participants (n = 116) voted to discuss the following hidden curriculum topics: ``coping with bias,'' ``assertive communication,'' ``knowing how things work,'' and ``developing a career.'' Many suggestions emphasized the role of institutions in empowering mentors to help diverse trainees and, more generally, to meaningfully support policies and programs that facilitate the career success of trainees and faculty from underrepresented backgrounds.                                         Conclusions:               This work generated a list of suggested action items for trainees, mentors, and institutions to ameliorate the hidden curricula of academia, especially for diverse trainees. However, institutions need to support changes that will facilitate these discussions as well as more broadly enable the success of faculty and students from diverse backgrounds.},

This book is a contribution to the multi-disciplined and multi-faceted conversation concerning the forms, uses and roles of data visualization in society. Do data visualizations do 'good' or 'bad'? Do they promote understanding and engagement, or do they do ideological work, privileging certain views of the world over others?

In so doing, the book highlights the notion that processes of language change long held to be universal are in fact shaped by cultural and typological variability. Taken together, this collection brings together perspectives from language documentation and historical linguistics toward pointing the way forward for richer understandings of language change and documentation and description, making this key reading for scholars in these fields"--},

  abstract = {In nineteenth-century Germany, breakthroughs in printing technology and an increasingly literate populace led to an unprecedented print production boom that has long presented scholars with a challenge: how to read it all? This anthology seeks new answers to the scholarly quandary of the abundance of text. Responding to Franco Moretti's call for \&quot;distant reading\&quot; and modeling a range of innovative approaches to literary-historical analysis informed by theburgeoning field of digital humanities, it asks what happens when we shift our focus from the one to the many, from the work to the network. The thirteen essays in this volume explore the evolving concept of \&quot;distant reading\&quot; and its application to the analysis of German literature and culture in the long nineteenth century. The contributors consider how new digital technologies enable both the testing of hypotheses and the discovery of patterns and trends, as well as how \&quot;distant\&quot; and traditional \&quot;close\&quot; reading can complement each another in hybrid models of analysis that maintain careful attention to detail, but also make calculation, enumeration, and empirical descriptioncritical elements of interpretation.

  abstract = {THIS IS NOT the first time that questions about the ``great unread'' have been raised with regard to eighteenth-century German studies. In the 1960s and early 1970s a variety of monographs sought to look beyond the canon to consider the entire range of imaginative fiction available to eighteenthcentury readers. Thanks to the efforts of such scholars as Marion Beaujean, Marianne Spiegel, Eva D. Becker, Albert Ward, and Rudolf Schenda, to name just a few, we know more about the broader literary landscape of the period than one might assume, not only with regard to its general topography but also the composition of the soil.None of the authors of these studies had access to electronic corpora, but they still managed to evaluate an impressively wide array of works. In Der Trivialroman in der zweiten H{\"a}lfte des 18. Jahrhunderts (1964) for example, Marion Beaujean includes no less than 46 novels by 27 authors. To be sure, this number represents only a small fraction of the total novels published in Germany in the eighteenth century. Marianne Spiegel includes a list of 1,287 titles (including translations) published between 1700 and 1770 as an appendix to her monograph of 1967, Der Roman und sein Publikum im fr{\"u}heren 18. Jahrhundert 1700--1767. Ten years later, Michael Hadley published his Romanverzeichnis: Bibliographie der zwischen 1750--1800 erschienenen Erstausgaben, which includes publication data for more than 5,000 novels. There is, however, little reason to doubt the validity of Beaujean's interpretations, which aim to classify (sub)genres and trace their evolution, inasmuch as they are based on plausible sampling techniques and corroborated by para- and extratextual evidence.What are the lessons to be learned from these earlier examples of a more comprehensive approach to literary history? The first and most obvious is simply that these efforts exist. The point has already been made in a variety of contexts, but it bears repeating: synoptic, as well as empirical and quantitative analysis, have a long history in literary studies, and whatever transformations are now occurring in the wake of increased access to digital corpora and the tools of data science, they constitute a recalibration rather than a rupture.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive overview into digital literary studies that equips readers to navigate the difficult contentions in this space. The Literary Agenda is a series of short polemical monographs about the importance of literature and of reading in the wider world and about the state of literary education inside schools and universities. The category of 'the literary' has always been contentious. What is clear, however, is how increasingly it is dismissed or is unrecognised as a way of thinking or an arena for thought. It is sceptically challenged from within, for example, by the sometimes rival claims of cultural history, contextualized explanation, or media studies. It is shaken from without by even greater pressures: by economic exigency and the severe social attitudes that can follow from it; by technological change that may leave the traditional forms of serious human communication looking merely antiquated. For just these reasons this is the right time for renewal, to start reinvigorated work into the meaning and value of literary reading. You may have heard of the digital humanities--and what you may have heard may not have been good. Yet like an oncoming storm, the relentless growth of the use of digital methods for the study of literature seems inevitable. This book gives an insight into the ways in which digital approaches can be used to study literature and the ways in which humanistic study can be used to explore digital literature. Examining its subject across the axes of authorship, space, and visualization, maps and place, distance and history, and ethical approaches to the digital humanities, this book introduces newcomers to the topic while also offering plenty for seasoned digital humanities pros. Combining original research with third-party case studies and examples, this book will appeal both to students and researchers across all levels who wish to learn about digital literary studies},

Aden Evens analyzes universal technological principles-in particular, the binary logic-to show that they encourage certain ways of thinking while making others more challenging or impossible. What is out of reach for any digital machine is {$<$}em{$>$}contingency,{$<$}/em{$>$} the ontological principle that refuses every rule. As humans engage ourselves and our world ever more through digital machines, we are losing touch with contingency and so banishing from our lives the accidental and unexpected that fuel our most creative and novel possibilities for living. Taking cues from philosophy rather than cultural or media theory, Evens argues that the consequences of this erosion of contingency are significant yet often overlooked because the same values that make the digital seem so desirable also make contingency seem unimportant-without contingency the digital is confined to what has already been thought, and yet the digital's ubiquity has allowed it to disguise this inherent sterility. Responsive only to desires that meet the demands of its narrow logic, the digital requires its users to practice those same ideological dictates, instituting a hegemony of thought and value sustained by the pervasive presence of digital mechanisms. Interweaving technical and philosophical concepts, {$<$}em{$>$}The Digital and Its Discontents{$<$}/em{$>$} advances a powerful and urgent argument about the digital and its impact on our lives. {$<$}strong{$>$}Retail e-book files for this title are screen-reader friendly.{$<$}/strong{$>$}},

In particular, Pirah culture constrains communication to nonabstract subjects which fall within the immediate experience of interlocutors. This constraint explains a number of very surprising features of Pirah grammar and culture: the absence of numbers of any kind or a concept of counting and of any terms for quantification, the absence of color terms, the absence of embedding, the simplest pronoun inventory known, the absence of relative tenses, the simplest kinship system yet documented, the absence of creation myths and fiction, the absence of any individual or collective memory of more than two generations past, the absence of drawing or other art and one of the simplest material cultures documented, and the fact that the Pirah are monolingual after more than 200 years of regular contact with Brazilians and the TupiGuaranispeaking Kawahiv.}

I demonstrate how Google Earth, by incorporating a social network that engages users as embodied interactors rather than disembodied voyeurs, is able to present user-generated content and dialog spatially on the very object that such content critiques. Ultimately, this study argues for ways that users can recontextualize and subvert `master representations' of visual media within the authorial structure rather than re-authoring the existing software and structures.},

For what concerns POS tagging, the effectiveness of retrained models is illustrated and substantiated with quantitative data, with a specific view to linguistic annotation results obtained with respect to specific language evolution stages, domains and textual genres. For lemmatization, different customized models have been developed, including lexicon-assisted ones and models retrained with historical annotated texts.

First, the evolution of academic concepts about digital identity and the online self is summarised. Then, the article investigates the key dynamics of personal strategies and control issues in detail with ideas, experiences, stories and metaphors taken from 60 qualitative interviews from Central and Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia. According to the key findings of this article, the universal patterns of online personal strategies follow mostly conscious decisions, resulting in users maintaining 70\% control of their digital footprints. However, the remaining 30\% of online activities are unconscious floating with digital dynamics and resulting in a wide range of non-expected consequences from identity theft to kidnapping. In summary, an intercultural and intergenerational model highlights the complexity and diversity of the studied field, providing a reference framework for future studies. The closing section presents a discussion of those findings of this study that are inconsistent with commonplace assumptions and conclusions present in the academic literature, promoting for study those subjects that still need to be extended or explored.},

Three experiments are summarized that were designed to investigate the reanalysis and interpretation of relatively difficult garden-path sentences (e.g., While Anna dressed the baby spit up on the bed). After reading such sentences, participants correctly believed that the baby spit up on the bed; however, they often confidently, yet incorrectly, believed that Anna dressed the baby. These results demonstrate that garden-path reanalysis is not an all-or-nothing process and that thematic roles initially assigned for the subordinate clause verb are not consistently revised. The implications of the partial reanalysis phenomenon for Fodor and Inoue's (1998) model of reanalysis and sentence processing are discussed. In addition, we discuss the possibility that language processing often creates ``good enough'' structures rather than ideal structures.}

Investigations of the misinterpretation of both garden-path and passive sentences have yielded support for the idea that the meaning people obtain for a sentence is often not a reflection of its true content. Moreover, incorrect interpretations may persist even after syntactic reanalysis has taken place. Our good-enough approach to language comprehension holds that language processing is sometimes only partial and that semantic representations are often incomplete. Future work will elucidate the conditions under which sentence processing is simply good enough.}

The main hypothesis was that if there is a tradeoff between dealing with current difficulty and keeping up with the incoming material, then we might expect superficial processing of the garden path, which would be observed in more errors. The results showed more errors in completing the garden path instruction compared to the immediately following second instruction. In this version of the task, participants did not show evidence of using the visual context to constrain the interpretation of a temporary ambiguity.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The diaries of Joseph Mathia Svoboda capture over 40 years of trade on the Tigris, describing his daily life and regular journeys as a steamboat purser during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, specifically between the cities of Basra and Baghdad. They offer a unique perspective on daily life, community structure, and social relations. However, with over 600 pages of transcribed material and many more diaries still in the process of being transcribed, it is difficult to track patterns and changes in Joseph Svoboda's social relationships and daily life by way of reading and inference alone. This article employs natural language processing (NLP) and network analysis to facilitate study of Svoboda's social interactions, as well as his observations of his broader social milieu. Inspection of the networks and accompanying visualizations showed that Svoboda's close interactions were primarily with kin, but his position as a steamship purser gave him a unique vantage point to encounter a wide range of persons of diverse backgrounds. Additionally, decomposing networks by time illustrated how significant life events facilitated change in social interactions.},

And so it is literally true that the basis of subjectivity is in the exercise of language {\textbackslash}ldotsLanguage is so organized that it permits each speaker to appropriate to himself an entire language by designating himself as I.Benveniste (1971:226)Among linguists and other professional students of language, the word subject and its derivative subjectivity tend to evoke a grammatical association: subject as distinct from direct object, for example. In some contexts, subjectivity contrasts with objectivity in suggesting something `soft', unverifiable, even suspicious. The essays in this book do treat subjectivity, and they are centrally linguistic in their focus, but they do not address subject as a grammatical relation. Nor do they address objective versus subjective modes of inquiry -- in linguistics or else where. Rather, broadly speaking, the subjectivity explored here concerns expression of self and the representation of a speaker's (or, more generally, a locutionary agent's) perspective or point of view in discourse -- what has been called a speaker's imprint. In turn, subjectivisation (or subjedification) refers to the structures and strategies that languages evolve in the linguistic realisation of subjectivity or to the relevant processes of linguistic evolution themselves.As used here, then, subjectivity has an array of meanings, neither so old nor so well studied as grammatical subjecthood, but central to emerging views of discourse -- to the intersection of language structure and language use in the expression of self.},

This article analyzes and discusses the current state of datafication research. Our dataset comprises 463 publications on datafication identified through a systematic literature search in Web of Science and Scopus, an explorative network analysis of keyword co-occurrences and a content analysis of these publications. We map datafication research interests in various research fields, find that the majority of studies are theoretically oriented, whereas empirical analyses largely apply qualitative approaches and rarely make use of data-driven methods. We suggest studies on datafication can be devised into categories reflecting research interests in either user understandings and practices or in infrastructure and technological processes of datafication. The latter strand is particularly sparse in empirical anchoring, and needs empirical and methodological attention. We conclude by outlining three paths for future datafication research to cross-pollinate infrastructural and user perspectives, highlighting the bridging role of communication research in such an endeavor.},

Exciting and innovative work appears fairly often in fiction, many picture books offer enticing visual and literary pleasures, and there are several non-fiction works for young people that are sophisticated and illuminating. But, with some notable exceptions, the vast bulk of children's poetry published today is goofy, sentimental or recycled from days of yore. As I write, the most recent children's poetry bestseller list from the Poetry Foundation (a spin-off of Poetry magazine in Chicago) contains, besides work by Shel Silverstein and Jack Prelutsky, primarily anthologies, such as Mary Engelbreit's Mother Goose: One Hundred Best-Loved Verses (2005) and A Family of Poems: My Favorite Poetry for Children (2005) edited by Caroline Kennedy. Caroline is, like her mother, a celebrity anthologist, and Mary Engelbreit is a franchise. This is, for the most part, the kind of fare one encounters at the large chain bookstores like Barnes and Noble.This market-driven narrowing of the genre is a shame because children's poetry is historically an expansive body of work. Until recently, the distinction between poetry for children and poetry for adults has been usefully blurred: prior to the late twentieth century, poetry anthologies for children tended to include verse traditionally considered 'adult', as well as an eclectic mixture of light verse, nonsense verse, narrative verse, along with lyric poetry.},

As part of this exploration, it is suggested that viewing discourse as composed of hierarchically arranged functional units, rather than as a string of clauses, strengthens our hypotheses concerning the relationships between discourse and grammar.}

  abstract = {This study describes and explains the paradox of related languages in contact that show signs of both linguistic divergence and convergence. Seventeen distinct languages are spoken in the northernmost islands of Vanuatu. These closely related Oceanic languages have evolved from an earlier dialect network, by progressive diversification. Innovations affecting word forms --- mostly sound change and lexical replacement --- have usually spread only short distances across the network; their accumulation over time has resulted in linguistic fragmentation, as each spatially-anchored community developed its own distinctive vocabulary. However, while languages follow a strong tendency to diverge in the form of their words, they also exhibit a high degree of isomorphism in their linguistic structures, and in the organization of their grammars and lexicons. This structural homogeneity, typically manifested by the perfect translatability of constructions across languages, reflects the traditions of mutual contact and multilingualism which these small communities have followed throughout their history. While word forms are perceived as emblematic of place and diffuse to smaller social circles, linguistic structures are left free to diffuse across much broader networks. Ultimately, the effects of divergence and convergence are the end result, over time, of these two distinct forms of horizontal diffusion.},

The Java and Python tools described provide computer-automated ways of performing useful tasks: 1. check the filenames well-formedness; 2. find user-defined characters in English language stories (e.g., social actors, i.e., individuals, groups, organizations; animals) (``find the character'') via WordNet; 3. aggregate words into higher-level aggregates (e.g., ``talk,'' ``say,'' ``write'' are all verbs of ``communication'') (``find the ancestor'') via WordNet; 4. evaluate human-created summaries of events taken from multiple sources where key actors found in the sources may have been left out in the summaries (``find the missing character'') via Stanford CoreNLP POS and NER annotators; 5. list the documents in an event cluster where names or locations present close similarities (``check the character's name tag'') using Levenshtein word/edit distance and Stanford CoreNLP NER annotator; 6. list documents categorized into the wrong event cluster (``find the intruder'') via Stanford CoreNLP POS and NER annotators; 7. classify loose documents into most-likely event clusters (``find the character's home'') via Stanford CoreNLP POS and NER annotators or date matcher; 8. find similarities between documents (``find the plagiarist'') using Lucene. These tools of automatic data checking can be applied to ongoing projects or completed projects to check data reliability. The NLP tools are designed with ``a fourth grader'' in mind, a user with no computer science background. Some five thousand newspaper articles from a project on racial violence (Georgia 1875--1935) are used to show how the tools work. But the tools have much wider applicability to a variety of problems of interest to both qualitative and quantitative scholars who deal with text as data.},

The results can be explained by the observation that simple past tense verbs convey an external viewpoint on an event, which presumably fits best when the event described has an endpoint. A definite description object supplies an endpoint. Consequently, to give up the late closure analysis of the post-verbal object when the verb is in the simple past tense, the processor is abandoning an analysis with semantically-expected properties for one which is not as good semantically. By contrast, a progressive verb denotes an activity which does not require an endpoint and therefore is neutral with respect to whether or not it takes an object.}

Kehler (2000, 2002) proposed an elegant theory which predicts a syntactic antecedent for an elided VP is required only for a certain discourse coherence relation (resemblance) not for cause-effect relations. Most of the data Kehler used to motivate his theory come from corpus studies and thus do not consist of true minimal pairs. We report five experiments testing predictions of the coherence theory, using standard minimal pair materials. The results raise questions about the empirical basis for coherence theory because parallelism is preferred for all coherence relations, not just resemblance relations. Further, strict identity readings, which should not be available when a syntactic antecedent is required, are influenced by parallelism per se, holding the discourse coherence relation constant. This draws into question the causal role of coherence relations in processing VP ellipsis.}

Although centered on evidence that has emerged from Fredrickson's Positive Emotions and Psychophysiology Laboratory (PEP Lab), it features key findings from other laboratories as well. It begins with a description of 10 representative positive emotions, alongside approaches for assessing them, both directly with the modified Differential Emotions Scale and indirectly through physiological and implicit measures. Next, it offers the seeds of the broaden-and-build theory, including work on the undo effect of positive emotions. It then reviews the state of the evidence for the twin hypotheses that stem from the broaden-and-build theory, the broaden hypothesis and the build hypothesis, including a focus on upward spiral dynamics. It touches next on new frontiers for the theory, including deeper investigations into the biological resources that positive emotions build as well as clinical and organizational applications. Finally, this contribution closes with a brief presentation of two offshoots from the broaden-and-build theory, namely, the upward spiral model of lifestyle change and work on love as positivity resonance between and among people. Both are targets of increasing work in the PEP Lab.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to uncover the day-to-day emotional profiles and dose-response relations, both within persons and between persons, associated with initiating one of two meditation practices, either mindfulness meditation or loving-kindness meditation. Data were pooled across two studies of midlife adults (N~=~339) who were randomized to learn either mindfulness meditation or loving-kindness meditation in a 6-week workshop. The duration and frequency of meditation practice was measured daily for 9~weeks, commencing with the first workshop session. Likewise, positive and negative emotions were also measured daily, using the modified Differential Emotions Scale (Fredrickson, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology 47:1--53, 2013). Analysis of daily emotion reports over the targeted 9-week period showed significant gains in positive emotions and no change in negative emotions, regardless of meditation type. Multilevel models also revealed significant dose-response relations between duration of meditation practice and positive emotions, both within persons and between persons. Moreover, the within-person dose-response relation was stronger for loving-kindness meditation than for mindfulness meditation. Similar dose-response relations were observed for the frequency of meditation practice. In the context of prior research on the mental and physical health benefits produced by subtle increases in day-to-day experiences of positive emotions, the present research points to evidence-based practices---both mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness meditation---that can improve emotional well-being.}

  abstract = {Two eye movement while reading experiments address the issue of how reading of an unpredictable word is influenced by the presence of a more predictable alternative. The experiments replicate the robust effects of predictability on the probability of skipping and on early and late reading time measures. However, in both experiments, an unpredictable but plausible word was read no more slowly when another word was highly predictable (i.e., in a constraining context) than when no word was highly predictable (i.e., in a neutral context). In fact, an unpredictable word that was semantically related to the predictable alternative demonstrated facilitation in the constraining context, in relatively late eye movement measures. These results, which are consistent with Luke and Christianson's (2016) corpus study, provide the first evidence from a controlled experimental design for the absence of a prediction error cost, and for facilitation of an unpredictable but semantically related word, during normal reading. The findings support a model of lexical predictability effects in which there is broad pre-activation of potential continuations, rather than discrete predictions of specific lexical items. Importantly, pre-activation of likely continuations does not result in processing difficulty when some other word is actually encountered.}

It looks at an instance where a single incident fed three different stories, each based on a distinct interpretation of the event. It also looks at three instances where particular stories had become part of organizational folklore, in each case crystallized around a single interpretation. Faced with such narratives, researchers may dismiss them as trifles of organizational life, or they may treat stories as clues leading to the `truth' about the organization. This chapter tests whether the folklorists' tenet that the primary function of storytelling is entertainment is valid in organizations. It also shows that even sad and anxiety-provoking stories can afford pleasure, albeit in oblique and unexpected ways. Yet, it is argued that, in contrast to the telling of fairy tales or folk tales, the telling of organizational stories frequently moves beyond entertainment, seeking to educate, persuade, warn, reassure, justify, explain, and console.},

The geometric relationship between these vectors captures meaningful semantic relationships between the corresponding words. In this paper, we develop a framework to demonstrate how the temporal dynamics of the embedding helps to quantify changes in stereotypes and attitudes toward women and ethnic minorities in the 20th and 21st centuries in the United States. We integrate word embeddings trained on 100 y of text data with the US Census to show that changes in the embedding track closely with demographic and occupation shifts over time. The embedding captures societal shifts---e.g., the women's movement in the 1960s and Asian immigration into the United States---and also illuminates how specific adjectives and occupations became more closely associated with certain populations over time. Our framework for temporal analysis of word embedding opens up a fruitful intersection between machine learning and quantitative social science.},

  abstract = {Increasing evidence supports the existence of distinct neural systems that subserve two dimensions of affect---arousal and valence. Ten adult participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during which they were presented a range of standardized faces and then asked, during the scan, to rate the emotional expressions of the faces along the dimensions of arousal and valence. Lower ratings of arousal accompanied greater activity in the amygdala complex, cerebellum, dorsal pons, and right medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). More negative ratings of valence accompanied greater activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) and parietal cortices. Extreme ratings of valence (highly positive and highly negative ratings) accompanied greater activity in the temporal cortex and fusiform gyrus. Building on an empirical literature which suggests that the amygdala serves as a salience and ambiguity detector, we interpret our findings as showing that a face rated as having low arousal is more ambiguous and a face rated as having extreme valence is more personally salient. This explains how both low arousal and extreme valence lead to greater activation of an ambiguity/salience system subserved by the amygdala, cerebellum, and dorsal pons. In addition, the right medial prefrontal cortex appears to down-regulate individual ratings of arousal, whereas the fusiform and related temporal cortices seem to up-regulate individual assessments of extreme valence when individual ratings are studied relative to group reference ratings for each stimulus. The simultaneous assessment of the effects of arousal and valence proved essential for the identification of neural systems contributing to the processing of emotional faces.},

In this book Richard Gerrig integrates insights from cognitive psychology and from research in linguistics, philosophy, and literary criticism to provide a cohesive account of what have most often been treated as isolated aspects of narrative experience. Drawing on examples from Tolstoi to Toni Morrison, Gerrig offers new analyses of some classic problems in the study of narrative. He discusses the ways in which we are cognitively equipped to tackle fictional and nonfictional narratives; how thought and emotion interact when we experience narrative; how narrative information influences judgments in the real world; and the reasons we can feel the same excitement and suspense when we reread a book as when we read it for the first time. Gerrig also explores the ways we enhance the experience of narratives, through finding solutions to textual dilemmas, enjoying irony at the expense of the characters in narrative, and applying a wide range of interpretive techniques to discover meanings concealed by and from authors.},

This study aimed to identify the role of project-based language learning in developing life skills of students through studying a case of a language class that included 80 students in two grade 6 classes in a private school. The study attempted to answer the following question: What is the role of project-based learning in developing students' life skills in an Arabic language class? To answer this question, we adopted a theoretical framework that included the following categories of life skills: personal and collaborative skills, self-orientation skills, and collective responsibility. The following three data collecting tools were used during the study: observation, semi-structured interviews, and the teacher and students' documents. Data collection lasted for two months from late September 2019 to December 2019. Data analysis followed the thematic analyses framework, by categorizing data into themes. The research results indicated that project-based learning helps to improve language students' personal and cooperative skills through developing their communication skills between themselves or with their teacher. In addition, project-based learning developed language students' mutual respect, their confidence, and their self-regulation of learning the Arabic language.},

  abstract = {With our increasing use of digital and online media, the way we interact with these forms of communication is having an enormous impact on our literacy and learning. In Digital Literacies, Julia Gillen argues that to a substantial extent Linguistics has failed to rise to the opportunities presented by studying language in digital contexts. Assuming no existing knowledge, and drawing from a wide range of research projects, she presents a range of approaches to the study of writing and reading language online. Challenging some of the existing concepts, Digital Literacies traces key ideas through both the history of literacy studies and contemporary approaches to language online, including linguistic ethnography and corpus linguistics. Examples, taken from real life studies, include the use of digital technologies in everyday life, online teenage communities and professional use of Twitter in journalism. Within each chapter, the relevant research methods used are explored and then tied to the theory underpinning them. This book is an innovative and essential read for all those studying and researching applied linguistics, particularly in the areas of literacy and multimodality, at an upper undergraduate and postgraduate level. The title will also be of interest to those working with new media in the fields of Media and Communication Studies, Cultural Psychology, and Education},

Here---following Agnew, Tuan, and others---we consider place as being made up of three components---location, locale, and sense of place---which are recognizable at multiple scales and vary historically as a product of social and political processes. Using the testimonies of two survivors of the Holocaust, we sketch the components of a model for a GIS of place that allows for this theory of place to be visualized and analyzed. The model is, crucially, both multi-scalar and sensitive to uncertainty, as a GIS of place needs to be able to zoom in and out of the different scales at which place is experienced, as well as capture both uncertain data and uncertainty as data. We see potential in the representations proposed for scaling up from the anecdotal to the general in the sense that any narrative can be grouped and classified according to places and scales as shown here. The challenge in developing a GIS of place along the lines we propose here is to design a new set of functionalities that can do so.},

Our work contributes to nascent research in spatial social networks in several ways, most importantly with its emphasis on uncertainty, the focus on edges as well as nodes, and the development of a visualization that allows for the prompt and immediate comparison of family structures regardless of their number.

This study used a constructivist grounded theory approach to examine humanities scholars' research practices, including their use of a wide range of resources and digital technologies. Using in-depth study, several themes emerged from the research relating to the role of technology in shaping humanities scholars' research practices. The themes include: (a) humanities scholars' research approaches and technology tools; (b) the humanities scholar as tool developer; (c) the role of data preparation as a meta-level research practice; (d) data visualization versus numeric outputs?one size does not fit all; (e) the importance of flexibility and agency; (f) technology tools in support of the researcher as writer; and (g) working alone/working together?technology tools and collaborative practice. The heterogeneous nature of humanities scholars' research practices are explored and the resulting implications for digital tool design. Two new research practices?tool development and data preparation?are proposed. The diverse digital technologies humanities scholars use support the traditional ways of working within their discipline, as well as creating potential for new scholarly practices.}

The findings indicated that attitudes correlated with a future behavior more strongly when they were easy to recall (accessible) and stable over time. Because of increased accessibility, attitudes more strongly predicted future behavior when participants had direct experience with the attitude object and reported their attitudes frequently. Because of the resulting attitude stability, the attitude-behavior association was strongest when attitudes were confident, when participants formed their attitude on the basis of behavior-relevant information, and when they received or were induced to think about one- rather than two-sided information about the attitude object.}

Using eye tracking, we explore how the processing of unfamiliar words changes with repeated exposure and how the repeated exposure and processing affect word learning. In two sessions, native and non-native English speakers read five chapters of an authentic English novel containing Dari words. After reading, participants received a comprehension test and three surprise vocabulary tests. Growth curve modeling revealed a non-linear decrease in reading times that followed an S shaped curve. Number of exposures was the strongest predictor of vocabulary learning (form and meaning), while total reading time independently contributed to the learning of word meaning. Thus, both quantity and quality of lexical processing aid incremental vocabulary development and may reveal themselves differently in readers' eye movement records.}

The story was presented by a microcomputer to permit monitoring and recording of on-line indices of physiological (i.e., heart rate) and cognitive (i.e., reading time) processes that might be related to imagery and emotional response. After readers had completed reading the story, their imagery and emotional responses were investigated more directly via free reports and ratings of story paragraphs. Although heart rate was not related to imagery or emotional response measures, reading time decreased as emotional response ratings increased. Despite several major procedural variations, imagery and emotional response ratings were highly correlated with those of a previous study using the same story (Sadoski and Goetz, 1985); the relationship between imagery and emotional response ratings remained virtually identical across the two studies. Free reports proved amenable to highly reliable coding procedures and provided a wealth of information regarding qualitative aspects of readers' imagery and emotional responses.}

Here we present a 2D map of the entire corpus of biomedical literature, and argue that it provides a unique and useful overview of the life sciences research. We based our atlas on the abstract texts of 21 million English articles from the PubMed database. To embed the abstracts into 2D, we used the large language model PubMedBERT, combined with             t             -SNE tailored to handle samples of our size. We used our atlas to study the emergence of the Covid-19 literature, the evolution of the neuroscience discipline, the uptake of machine learning, the distribution of gender imbalance in academic authorship, and the distribution of retracted paper mill articles. Furthermore, we present an interactive web version of our atlas that allows easy exploration and will enable further insights and facilitate future research.},

A Study in Scarlet, the novella that introduced Sherlock Holmes, offers the first meditation on distant reading. A split double plot that anticipates generic fissures within crime fiction broadly conceived, A Study in Scarlet creates a data-centric detective intelligence in dialogue with late Victorian statistical innovations that remain central to machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) today. Doyle's generically split novella shows that the charismatic detective who dominates its first part is the merely partial virtuoso of a limited form. As such, A Study in Scarlet invites us to contemplate and clarify the humanistic stakes of machine ``reading'' during what some AI commentators conceive as a fourth industrial revolution.},

  abstract = {This paper offers a working conversation between the authors about the uneasy relationship between literacy studies and learning technologies. We come from the field of literacy studies but from contrasting perspectives: from academic literacies and work on literacies and technologies in higher education; from an interest in media theory and the implications of digital mediation for the contemporary university; from everyday literacies in informal settings and a concern for the gaps between policy and practice. We illustrate our perspectives through reference to post-compulsory education, especially higher education, but intend our arguments to be of broader value to all sectors of education and learning. We argue that it is probably inevitable that terms such as literacy/digital/network will be taken up by different arenas of scholarship and practice to mean different things, but what is important is finding spaces to make visible the embedded and implicit understandings, assumptions and ideological positions that are carried by these terms. In the paper, we attempt to lay bare some of the tendencies in the different approaches and argue the case for building on these differences in our work rather than seeing them as paradigm contests. We suggest that it would be more generative to the field to acknowledge the richness and diversity of these different traditions, rather than attempting the impossible task of forcing them into a superficial reconciliation.Keywords:~literacies; digital; textual practices; learning landscapes; ethnographic(Published: 31 January 2014)Citation: Research in Learning Technology 2014,~21: 21438 - http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/rlt.v21.21438},

The aim of the book is to illustrate how the use of historical GIS is changing our understanding of the geographies of the past, and how it has become the foundation for new approaches to the study of history. The essays are divided into two parts. The first features new approaches to the past by focusing on current developments in the use of historical sources. The second looks at the insights gained by applying GIS to develop historiography. Together the essays form, not a 'how-to' guide for researchers, but a compelling demonstration of how GIS can contribute to our historical understanding"--},

The first was an analysis of patterns of long-term change in the ethnic composition and socio-economic geography of the island based upon historic census data. Many of these records had recently been digitized as part of complementary concurrent investments in making historic quantitative data available to a wider scholarly and public audience. By rendering these spatially detailed historic census datasets available for long time periods, these investments laid the groundwork for a project such as 139`Troubled Geographies', which could use them to track changes in patterns of religion and ethnicity over the long term and assess how change in ethnicity related to wider social and economic trends and developments.},

The present overview relates psychoanalysis - historically, the predominant psychological approach of literary scholars - to poetics (or literary semiotics) and suggests that psychoanalysts and poeticians, because of a natural distrust for the anti-mentalistic bias of behaviorist psychology, have been show in taking full advantage of the pro-mentalistic, process-oriented views of cognitive scientists in cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence. The first part of this overview, 'Freudianism versus Psychoanalysis: A Historical Survey', is divided into seven sections: Beyond Freud; Ego psychology; Object relations theory; Self psyvhology; The impact of Jacques Lacan; Psychoanalysis and contemporary psychology; Stages of Cognitive and psychosexual development in psychology and psychoanalysis. The second part on 'Psychology and Poetics' considers two classic alternatives: the choice between a structural and a functional view of literature and the status of the text between author and reader. The last two sections consider the contributions of experimental poetics, German-language poetics, and artificial intelligence to a psychologically based theory of texts. {\copyright} 1984.},

These investigated the way in which different perspectives coexist and alternate in her writing, suggesting that the use of such techniques often results in ambiguous perspective shifts. However, there is hardly any empirical evidence as to whether readers experience difficulty while reading her narratives as a result of these narrative techniques. This article examines empirically readers' responses to extracts from Woolf's two major novels -- To the Lighthouse and Mrs Dalloway -- to provide evidence to whether Woolf's techniques for the presentation of characters' voices, thoughts and perspectives represent a challenge for readers. To achieve this, a mixed-methods approach that combines a stylistic analysis with a detailed questionnaire has been employed. Selected extracts that were hypothesised to be complex due to the presence of free indirect style and/or interior monologue were modified by substituting these with less ambiguous modes of consciousness presentation, such as direct speech or direct thought. Readers' responses to the modified and unmodified versions of the same extracts were compared: results show that the presence of free indirect style and/or interior monologue increases the number of perspectives identified by readers, suggesting that this technique increases the texts' difficulty, laying a more solid ground for future investigations.},

  abstract = {With the development of new powerful technologies for computational data analysis, the opportunities for -- and interest in -- the detection of sentiments and opinion in texts have grown considerably (Liu 2015). Because of the vast amount of material available online, these investigations have focused mostly on textual material gathered from social media, making use of traditional corpus linguistic approaches as well as deep learning tools. Sophisticated sentiment analysis (SA) of literary texts, especially in languages other than English, is still in its infancy (Kim and Klinger 2019). This has depended partly on the limited amount of digital texts available, partly the complex structure of literary texts, and finally on methodological challenges, with skills needed that seldom form part of the training of literary scholars. Emotions are however central to the experience of literary narrative (Oatley 2012; Hogan 2016), and recent advances in their systematic, quantitative analysis have been made within computational literary studies. Yet, such investigations have mostly relied on existing lists of words associated with sentiment and emotion values, the so-called sentiment lexicons. While these remain conventional and useful tools, they can only provide limited insights to the representation of emotions in texts. Using a lexicon-based method, we have previously investigated emotions and sentiments in relation to the representation of landscape in Swiss literature, looking in particular at the differences between the rural and urban spaces portrayed in a corpus of Swiss novels written in German (see Grisot, G., Herrmann, J.B. (in preparation). The present paper takes a step forward, using manual annotation and advanced machine learning methods to train a fine-tuned model to recognise valence and arousal on a historical corpus. Our goals are higher levels of lexical coverage and validity when compared to our prior results obtained with sentiment lexicons. We describe here the current state of our method to detect sentiment using deep learning approaches. Using a language model trained on a large corpus (3000+) of German literary texts spanning from 1800 to 1950 (Fischer and Str{\"o}tgen 2017), we make use of BERT word embeddings and manually annotated sentences to recognise sentiment. 500+ sentences were taken from three Swiss-German novels - one of which children's fiction - and annotated for valence - understood here as the degree of 'positivity' of the detected sentiment - and arousal - its 'intensity' or 'degree of activation' - by two trained student assistants using the same instructions. Currently, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) between manual annotators calculated on these sentences is 0.721 for valence and 0.606 for arousal. Scores for individual texts indicated preliminary evidence of a genre effect, with higher ICCs for the children's novel (valence 0.86; arousal 0.78 for 149 sentences) as compared to the other two, more complex, realist novels (valence 0.78, 0.62 arousal for 182 sentences; 0.51 for valence, 0.41 arousal for 198 sentences). The annotated sample was used to train a deep learning classifier, using linear regression to finetune the Literary German BERT model (https://huggingface.co/severinsimmler/literary-german-bert), which reached Pearson's r scores of 0.53 for valence and 0.63 for arousal. These scores are very promising, suggesting the possibility - provided more training data - of a full automation of the annotation task on our domain of historical literary texts. We are currently appending the annotation and at the time of the conference shall be able to update the results on a broader data base. While potentially taking automatic SA of German literary texts to a new level, our study also allows evaluating the performance of lexicon-based in direct comparison with deep learning SA approaches, thus allowing to gauge the validity of different SA methods on a data-driven basis. This approach also raises questions concerning the effect of genre on the ease and validity of manual sentiment annotations.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the representation and affective encoding of fictional space in a corpus of 125 Swiss literary prose texts of the 19th and early 20th Century written in German, offering a contribution to both spatial and affective literary studies.             Motivated by questions about the iconic dichotomy between `urban' and `rural/natural' space in literary works (Sengle; Fournier; Nell and Weiland) -- and in Swiss literature around 1900 in particular (Rehm) -- we use computational methods to detect and examine how different types of space are distributed and affectively encoded in German-Swiss literature. Taking into account the complexity of cultural perceptions and representations of space across history, we examine the presence of `urban' and `rural/natural' fictional spaces and their potential role in constructing a `Swiss' national literature (B{\"o}hler; Zimmer), and their affective encoding.             In order to do this, we first compiled a comprehensive dictionary of named and non-named spatial entities in the broad spatial categories RURAL and URBAN, and examined the presence of sentiment and emotions (valence and discrete emotions) and their `strength' (arousal) in relation to these. We used current state-of-the-art sentiment lexicons for German available to the digital humanities community. Similarly to Heuser et al., we mapped the spatial entities and the sentiment lexicons onto our corpus, and focused on spans of +/-50 words around the detected entities, in order to examine the specific sentiment and emotions related to space.             In an exploratory analysis, we offer here a first-time data-driven perspective on rural and urban fictional space, incorporating the dimension of affective encoding of space systematically.},

  abstract = {Thanks to the development of new powerful technologies for computational data analysis, an increasing number of researchers has investigated sentiment in texts, making use of traditional corpus linguistic approaches as well as machine learning tools. When considering literary texts, however, sentiment analysis is still in its infancy, especially when it focuses on languages other than English [1]. Crucially, only very few studies so far have related the representation of sentiment and emotions to that of space. This has depended partly on the limited amount of literary texts available digitally and partly of the challenges of defining and identifying space in literature. Emotions and space are however central to the experience of literary narrative [2, 3, 4], and recent advances in their systematic, quantitative analysis have been made within computational literary studies [5, 6, 7]. Using lexicon-based methods, Grisot and Herrmann [8] investigated emotions and sentiments in relation to the representation of literary space, looking in particular at the differences between the rural and urban landscapes portrayed in a corpus of Swiss novels written in German. The present paper takes a step forward, building on their data and using manual annotation and advanced machine learning methods to train a fine-tuned model, in order to automatically detect and recognise on the one hand sentiment (valence, arousal) and discrete emotions (joy, anger, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise), and on the other spatial entities (named and unnamed), in a historical corpus of Swiss novels. With such model, we aim at higher levels of lexical coverage and validity when compared to existing results obtained with sentiment lexicons and entities lists. Using a language model trained on a large corpus (3000+) of German literary texts spanning from 1800 to 1950 (Literary German BERT [9]), we make use of BERT word embeddings [10], Prodigy active learning tool [11] and manually annotated sentences to recognise sentiment, emotions and space, and see whether and how these relate to one another. More than 6000 sentences were taken from Swiss-German novels and annotated for discrete emotions, valence (understood here as the degree of 'positivity' of the detected emotion) and arousal (its 'intensity' or 'degree of activation'), while active learning was used on more than 4000 sentences to implement existing lists of labelled spatial entities. Annotations were conducted by several trained student assistants. The annotated samples were employed to train a deep learning classifier using BERT transformers. In this preliminary phase we reached an accuracy over 70\% on valence prediction, an over 66\% on emotion prediction, and an around 64\% on arousal prediction. In terms of space, we used active learning on a word2vec model bootstrapped with a Swiss Geographic location corpus, annotating sentences on six categories (geolocations: *geo-rural, geo-natural, geo-urban*, and spatial terms (unnamed): *rural, natural, urban*). For these, we obtained the following preliminary results: F1: .65, precision: .66, and recall: .64. These scores are very promising, suggesting the possibility -- provided more training data -- of a full automation of the annotation task on our domain of historical literary texts, both in terms of sentiments and in terms of spatial entities. We are currently gathering more annotations, and at the time of the conference shall be able to update the results on a broader data base, and to show whether our model will be able to predict a relation between sentiments and space in Swiss literature. While potentially taking automatic SA of German literary texts to a new level, our study also allows evaluating the performance of lexicon-based in direct comparison with deep learning SA approaches, thus allowing to gauge the validity of different SA methods on a data-driven basis.

The main purpose was to shed light on the definition of the word "data" in the humanities domain, as far as FAIR data management practices are concerned, and on what researchers think of the term. Methodology: We invited one researcher for each of the official disciplinary areas represented within the department and all 19 accepted to participate in the study. Participants were then divided into 5 main research areas: philology and literary criticism, language and linguistics, history of art, computer science, archival studies. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using a grounded theory approach. Findings: A list of 13 research data types has been compiled thanks to the information collected from participants. The term "data" does not emerge as especially problematic, although a good deal of confusion remains. Looking at current research management practices, methodologies and teamwork appear more central than previously reported. Originality: Our findings confirm that "data" within the FAIR framework should include all types of input and outputs humanities research work with, including publications. Also, the participants to this study appear ready for a discussion around making their research data FAIR: they do not find the terminology particularly problematic, while they rely on precise and recognised methodologies, as well as on sharing and collaboration with colleagues.},

Its increasingly widespread use ushered in a wave of commentary and scholarship seeking to meld wellestablished bodies of knowledge on mass media, economics, and social movements with the affordances of this new communication technology. Several political upheavals and an election later, the outlook in both the popular press and scholarly discussions is decidedly less optimistic. Facebook and Twitter are more likely to be discussed as incubators of ``fake news'' and propaganda than as tools for empowerment and social change. The resulting research focus has changed, too, with scholars looking to earlier literatures on misperceptions and persuasion for insight into the challenges of the present. The terms ``misinformation,'' ``disinformation,'' and ``propaganda'' are sometimes used interchangeably, with shifting and overlapping definitions. All three concern false or misleading messages spread under the guise of informative content, whether in the form of elite communication, online messages, advertising, or published articles. For the purposes of this chapter, we define misinformation as constituting a claim that contradicts or distorts common understandings of verifiable facts. This is distinct conceptually from rumors or conspiracy theories, whose definitions do not hinge on the truth value of the claims being made. Instead, rumors are understood as claims whose power arises from social transmission itself (Berinsky 2015). Conspiracy theories have specific characteristics, such as the belief that a hidden group of powerful individuals exerts control over some aspect of society (Sunstein and Vermeule 2009).}

  abstract = {This article focuses on the transcription of medieval manuscripts. Whereas problems of transcription have long interested medievalists, few workable options in the era of printed editions were available besides normalisation. The automation of this process, known as handwritten text recognition (HTR), has made new kinds of digital text creation possible, but also has foregrounded the necessity of theorising transcription in our scholarly practices. We reflect here on different notions of transcription against the backdrop of changing text technologies. Moreover, drawing on our own research on medieval Latin Bibles, we present general guidelines for customizing transcription schemes, arguing that they must be designed with specific research questions and scholarly end use in mind. Since we are particularly interested in the scribal contribution to the production of codices, our transcription guidelines aim to capture abbreviations and orthographic variation between different textual witnesses for downstream machine learning tasks. In the final section of the article, we discuss a few examples of how the HTR-created transcriptions allow us to address new questions at scale in medieval manuscripts, such as textual variance across witnesses, the prediction of a change in scribal hands within a single manuscript as well as the profiling of individual and regional scribal characteristics.},

First, the data of the past may be occluded -- historians are trained to look for silences and gaps in historical accounts, and a digital scholar must develop literacy in these matters lest their analysis be riddled with inaccuracies and distortions. A second danger is dirty data, not in the sense of transmission errors, but rather, cultural biases and conceptual distortions in the source material itself that, when left unrecognized, can result in distorted narratives. A third danger in text mining is fantasy -- the gross misapprehension that models of the past can function as a prediction machine. Critically reviewing projects framed by misunderstandings of history that resulted from data-driven inquiries, this chapter explores a crucial aspect of research in the humanities: the imperfection of archives, the skew of libraries, and the inherent bias of language, and how literacy in these matters means approaching even the best archives with caution.},

Influence and agency, or cause and effect, only scratch the surface of the multiple ways we tell stories about the past. As we reflect upon the past from multiple perspectives, we see that history is far more than a simple story -- it is a vast house with many windows. This chapter examines how historical events can be seen as ruptures from the past, or conversely, as repetitions of the past, and how a researcher can separate signal from noise, and discern the truly meaningful historical events. The chapter explores historians' tools for navigating temporal experience, drawing on recent theoretical work by Stephen Tanaka, Astrid Erll, and Reinhart Koselleck. It suggests that data-driven examinations of history are most effective when modeled to match a perspectival, theory-driven representation of only one of the multiple dimensions of history, and so offers the intellectual foundation for the chapters that follow.},

To develop a critical perspective on the past, the researcher must investigate the ``fit'' between data, algorithm, secondary sources, and analysis. Recursively iterating through each part of the research process, one develops not so much the one true portrait of the past, but rather a portrait of the past in its multiple dimensions. We see that rigorous methodology produces not certainty, but on the contrary, layers of contingency. This chapter discusses exemplarity, cherrypicking, and common issues of sloppy analysis, and the imperfect grounds upon which historical narratives are built, as they are coded with ethnocentrism and other biases. The bulk of the chapter lays out a threefold method for addressing these issues with critical thinking and an energetically iterative approach. First, through seeding, that is, asking a wide range of essential questions about the data and about methodological approach to the data, and then applying these parameters, as a way to set up the most robust experiment possible. Second, through broad winnowing, the next stage in the experiment, where the scholar pores over the returns of the query to sort signal from noise, sturdy from flimsy, gathering up the promising results, and discarding the less clear or less relevant information. And thirdly, guided reading, in which the research turns to textual sources that can bring new knowledge to the known archives.},

These precepts are, in effect, pedagogical principles that can be useful for bringing researchers from diverse disciplinary backgrounds into a basic acquaintance with the practice of humanist interpretation. As a cursory introduction to critical thinking in the humanities, these precepts may help data analysts to imagine what sorts of skills, teams, and training might work together to produce a rigorous approach to data about human experience.},

Engaging recent critiques of predictive logic by Jill Lepore, it touches upon the misuses of partially accurate predictive machines -- the marketing research technology that has become part of the fabric of political and social life in our time -- often with disastrous consequences. The chapter revisits the fantastic project of Peter Turchin, to map out predictive laws of human society, analyzing him against objections against modeling the evolution of human interactions as law-like, from Karl Popper to William Sewell. It engages the theoretical work of Reinhart Koselleck, who argues that prediction or prophecy is untenable, and that we only have prognosis. It looks at the conditions under which Koselleck imagines ``prognosis'' to be tenable, including the example of grievance theory, which refrains from predicting how or when a group might respond to historical oppression, and only describes the dynamics and acknowledges when there are ``grounds'' for revolt. The chapter makes room for readers who have turned to this book out of an interest in modeling or prediction to enter a more robust engagement with history, which is presented here as the source of a rigorous engagement with problems of change over time.},

Textual data can even prove who was responsible in Congress for silencing environmentalism over recent decades.

They have attracted significant attention and been deployed in numerous downstream applications. Nevertheless, akin to a double-edged sword, LLMs also present potential risks. They could suffer from private data leaks or yield inappropriate, harmful, or misleading content. Additionally, the rapid progress of LLMs raises concerns about the potential emergence of superintelligent systems without adequate safeguards. To effectively capitalize on LLM capacities as well as ensure their safe and beneficial development, it is critical to conduct a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs. This survey endeavors to offer a panoramic perspective on the evaluation of LLMs. We categorize the evaluation of LLMs into three major groups: knowledge and capability evaluation, alignment evaluation and safety evaluation. In addition to the comprehensive review on the evaluation methodologies and benchmarks on these three aspects, we collate a compendium of evaluations pertaining to LLMs' performance in specialized domains, and discuss the construction of comprehensive evaluation platforms that cover LLM evaluations on capabilities, alignment, safety, and applicability. We hope that this comprehensive overview will stimulate further research interests in the evaluation of LLMs, with the ultimate goal of making evaluation serve as a cornerstone in guiding the responsible development of LLMs. We envision that this will channel their evolution into a direction that maximizes societal benefit while minimizing potential risks.

Our main focus is to handle lexical modifier negation during SWN score calculation for the improvement of classification performance. Thus, we present naive and novel shift approach in which negation acts as both sentiment-bearing word and modifier, and then we shift the score of words from SWN based on their contextual semantic, inferred from neighbouring words. Additionally, we augment negation accounting procedure with a few heuristics for handling the cases in which negation presence does not necessarily mean negation. Experimental results show that the contextual-based SWN feature vector obtained through shift polarity approach alone led to an improved Twitter sentiment analysis system that outperforms the traditional reverse polarity approach by 2--6\%. We validate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach considering negation on benchmark Twitter corpus from SemEval-2013 Task 2 competition.}

  abstract = {Cultures of Inquiry provides an overview of research methodologies in social science, historical and cultural studies. Facing Kant's proposition that pure reason cannot contain social inquiry, John R. Hall uses a method of hermeneutic deconstruction to produce a 'critique of impure reason', thereby charting a 'third path' to knowledge. Inquiries conventionally allocated to science or interpretation, modern or postmodern, he argues, depend upon interconnected methodologies that transcend present-day disciplinary and interdisciplinary boundaries. He identifies four formative discourses and eight methodological practices of inquiry, and explores new possibilities for translation between different types of knowledge. Cultures of Inquiry neither exoticizes academic subcultures nor essentializes Culture as the spirit of academe. Instead, it addresses workaday issues of research via a sociology of knowledge that speaks to controversies concerning how inquiry is and ought to be practiced under conditions of epistemological disjuncture},

To explore this worrisome phenomenon, this study aims to investigate the effects of political misinformation by integrating three theoretical approaches: (1) misinformation, (2) polarization, and (3) selective exposure. In this article, we examine the role of fact-checkers in discrediting polarized misinformation in a fragmented media environment. We rely on two experiments ( N = 1,117) in which we vary exposure to attitudinal-congruent or incongruent political news and a follow-up fact-check article debunking the information. Participants were either forced to see or free to select a fact-checker. Results show that fact-checkers can be successful as they (1) lower agreement with attitudinally congruent political misinformation and (2) can overcome political polarization. Moreover, dependent on the issue, fact-checkers are most likely to be selected when they confirm prior attitudes and avoided when they are incongruent, indicating a confirmation bias for selecting corrective information. The freedom to select or avoid fact-checkers does not have an impact on political beliefs.},

In this paper, we explore three relationships between populism and (un)truthfulness: (1) the cultivation of a conspiracy theory in populist discourse; (2) populism's denial or discrediting of expert knowledge or empirical information, and the legitimacy of journalism and mainstream sources of knowledge and (3) populist constructions of alternative truths that resonate with common sense and the experiences of the ordinary people. We further explore the effects of discourses of (un)truthfulness, and ways to combat the potentially negative political consequences of populist disinformation. Together, by exploring the discursive relationship between populism and (un)truthfulness, this paper aims to provide more detailed insights in how populist versions of reality and dishonesty that attack mainstream knowledge and interpretations may impact society and political decision-making.},

Yet, many forced exposure media effect studies in the field of political communication studying polarizing issues such as disinformation and populism assume a baseline level of trust among participants exposed to seemingly neutral information. This neglects long-standing issues of distrust in the press and trends toward increasing distrust among growing segments of the population. Resistance toward established information presented as news may result in unanticipated findings, as a substantial part of the population may not accept these sources as trustworthy or neutral. To enlighten confusion, this article relies on two different experiments ({$<$}em{$>$}N{$<$}/em{$>$} = 728 and {$<$}em{$>$}N{$<$}/em{$>$} = 738) to explore how citizens with low levels of trust and high dissatisfaction with the established order respond to information from established information sources. Our main findings indicate that participants with higher levels of populist attitudes, media distrust, and fake news perceptions are more likely to find established information untrustworthy. They are also less likely to agree with the statements of such content. These findings indicate that media effect studies assuming univocal acceptance of seemingly neutral information may fall short in incorporating problematic trends toward factual relativism in their design.},

(3) How can poetry writing be studied? Together the answers to these questions provide a rationale for the proposed research agenda and an overview of ways in which this project can be accomplished. A review of the literature on poetry writing reveals a process which involves extensive revision within a recursive writing process that reaffirms the characterization of poetry as a genre that combines attention to meaning with attention to form.}

Contrary to conventional wisdom, communication partners readily distinguished between positive and negative valence emotional communicators in this text-based context. The results are discussed with respect to the Social Information Processing model of strategic relational adaptation in mediated communication. Copyright 2007 ACM.},

Studies using single sentences found that 3rd person pronouns facilitate the construction of a mental model from an observer's perspective, whereas 2nd person pronouns support an actor's perspective. The direction of the effect for 1st person pronouns seems to depend on the situational context. In the present study, we investigated how personal pronouns influence discourse comprehension when people read fiction stories and if this has consequences for affective components like emotion during reading or appreciation of the story. We wanted to find out if personal pronouns affect immersion and arousal, as well as appreciation of fiction. In a natural reading paradigm, we measured electrodermal activity and story immersion, while participants read literary stories with 1st and 3rd person pronouns referring to the protagonist. In addition, participants rated and ranked the stories for appreciation. Our results show that stories with 1st person pronouns lead to higher immersion. Two factors-transportation into the story world and mental imagery during reading-in particular showed higher scores for 1st person as compared to 3rd person pronoun stories. In contrast, arousal as measured by electrodermal activity seemed tentatively higher for 3rd person pronoun stories. The two measures of appreciation were not affected by the pronoun manipulation. Our findings underscore the importance of perspective for language processing, and additionally show which aspects of the narrative experience are influenced by a change in perspective.},

Visual narratives exploit a mechanism that generates aversion towards people who look different. Being ``different'' by definition is in relation to a statistical norm, whether the difference concerns body size, skin color, hair styles, gender, visible physical disabilities, or facial anomalies. We often associate unattractive faces or faces with anomalies with poor character or negative personality traits. The evidence that most people harbor (implicit) biases against others who visibly differ from the norm is overwhelming, while people who approximate a statistical average within a population are regarded as beautiful and morally good. While we do not yet understand the (neuro-)biological and cognitive bases of these stereotypes, some recent neuroimaging evidence suggests that people not only pay greater attention to faces with anomalies but also simultaneously inhibit social and emotional responses.},

The proponents of this methodology focus on levels of "discourse constraints" that give meaning to public behavior in their attempt to link the "explanation" of texts to an "understanding" of context. The argument can be extended to the search by cognitive scientists and psycholinguists for constraints on the "discourse of thought," including the interrelationship of thought and the context within which thinking takes place.*The "texts" of human behavior, linguistic or otherwise, seem to cohere. Discovering how the principles of coherence are acquired by individuals as they develop, and how this "tacit knowledge" informs "public action," will require joint effort by many social scientists, including psychologists. A rigorous interpretive approach also requires that we acknowledge how, as researchers, we add layers of meaning to the activities we observe.]}

We use a similar approach to the Basic Language Resource Kit (BLARK) in developing the suggested framework. DH as a fairly new field, which has emerged at an intersection of digital technologies and humanities, currently has no framework based on which one could assess the status of the essential elements required for conducting research in a specific language or community. DH offers new research opportunities and challenges in the humanities, computer science and its relevant technologies, hence such a framework could provide a starting point for educational strategists, researchers, and software developers to understand the prerequisites for their tasks and to have a statistical base for their decisions and plans. The suggested framework has been applied in the context of Kurdish DH, considering Kurdish as a less-resourced language. We have also applied the method to the Gaelic language in the Scottish community. Although the research has focused on less-resourced and minority languages, it concludes that DHuRAF has the potential to be generalized in a variety of different contexts. Furthermore, despite significant reliance on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computational utilities, the research showed that DH could also be used as an essential resource pool to leverage the NLP study of less-resourced and minority languages.},

After remarks on the historical background of the so-called NIKOL conception of an empirical science of literature, I shall outline the three levels needed for the construction of an empirical science of literature: epistemology, metatheoretical presuppositions, and object-theories (i.e., theory consisting of four sub-theories). Value dimensions underlying these levels will be discussed together with practical application of the theory. Current and past projects as well as the future tasks of an empirical science of literature will be presented in the final section. Because the concepts and the structure of an empirical theory of literature are bound to the structure and function of scientific theories and to the notion of empirical knowledge, I shall first survey foundational issues in the hope that this mode of presentation will help the reader appreciate the scope of our approach.}

This chapter and the next focus, instead, on exploring our physical and conceptual experiences with technology, how we meet it, and what it does. For this chapter I want to consider what it is like to encounter a physical artefact as equipment, as something to be used, and the ways in which that encounter is structured by our prior experience. I want to explore in particular how those artefacts that we use most closely, technologically, are both objects and shapers of cognition and perception, how they are both moulded in and come to mould our minds.},

In some ways the argument of the next two chapters is simpler: the artefacts that we experience as technologies are embodiments of knowledge. And this might seem intuitively correct --- the more that humans learn the better (for some value of ``better'') their technologies become. This is certainly true, but it's also not the whole story, or the only story, that I want to tell here about the relationship between technology and knowledge. Technology, particularly as viewed from a postphenomenological perspective, is one of the fundamental relationships that we can have with the world, and as such it necessarily opens up questions about knowledge and what it means to know. Much as with the word ``technology,'' however, ``knowledge'' is a messy term which needs to be pinned down before it can be discussed, and because we are investigating material encounters, we also need to work out the relationship between the knowledge stored in things in the world and those who encounter that world --- this requires a theory of both ``information'' and ``data.'' I want to argue that not only does an understanding of technology require an understanding of such fundamental epistemological questions, but that the technological encounter that I've described can also give us an approach to how we come to know.},

  abstract = {Lulled into somnolence by five hundred years of print, literary analysis should awaken to the importance of media-specific analysis, a mode of critical attention which recognizes that all texts are instantiated and that the nature of the medium in which they are instantiated matters. Central to repositioning critical inquiry, so it can attend to the specificity of the medium, is a more robust notion of materiality. Materiality is reconceptualized as the interplay between a text's physical characteristics and its signifying strategies, a move that entwines instantiation and signification at the outset. This definition opens the possibility of considering texts as embodied entities while still maintaining a central focus on interpretation. It makes materiality an emergent property, so that it cannot be specified in advance,as if it were a pregiven entity. Rather, materiality is open to debate and interpretation, ensuring that discussions about the text's``meaning'' will also take into account its physical specificity as well.              Following the emphasis on media-specific analysis, nine points can be made about the specificities of electronic hypertext: they are dynamic images; they include both analogue resemblance and digital coding; they are generated through fragmentation and recombination; they have depth and operate in three dimensions; they are written in code as well as natural language; they are mutable and transformable; they are spaces to navigate; they are written and read in distributed cognitive environments; and they initiate and demand cyborg reading practices.},

But the advent of computational media has exponentially increased the pace, transforming how books are composed, designed, edited, typeset, distributed, sold, and read. N. Katherine Hayles traces the emergence of what she identifies as the postprint condition, exploring how the interweaving of print and digital technologies has changed not only books but also language, authorship, and what it means to be human. Hayles considers the ways in which print has been enmeshed in literate societies and how these are changing as some of the cognitive tasks once performed exclusively by humans are now carried out by computational media. Interpretations and meaning-making practices circulate through transindividual collectivities created by interconnections between humans and computational media, which Hayles calls cognitive assemblages. Her theoretical framework conceptualizes innovations in print technology as redistributions of cognitive capabilities between humans and machines. Humanity is becoming computational, just as computational systems are edging toward processes once thought of as distinctively human. Books in all their diversity are also in the process of becoming computational, representing a crucial site of ongoing cognitive transformations. Hayles details the consequences for humanities publications through interviews with scholars and university press professionals and considers the cultural implications in readings of two novels, The Silent History and The Word Exchange, that explore the postprint condition. Spanning fields including book studies, cultural theory, and media archeology, Postprint is a strikingly original consideration of the role of computational media in the ongoing evolution of humanity"--},

Through a series of worked examples, this accessible primer then demonstrates how to create plots piece by piece, beginning with summaries of single variables and moving on to more complex graphics.

  abstract = {The hidden curriculum is the broad set of values, norms and practices in education that are rarely explicitly taught but may be tacitly known. This is particularly acute in the transition from school to university, but also when entering higher education on alternative routes: first-year undergraduate students do not all share the same prior insights into or expectations of university learning, potentially exacerbating systemic inequalities. We present a flexible framework for uncovering and addressing the hidden curriculum in the transition to university, with particular focus on direct entry from secondary school. The framework is designed to be applied in subject-specific contexts to address specific needs and involves three key stages of (i) planning, (ii) investigation, and (iii) analysis and targeting of the hidden curriculum. The planning stage engages current students as co-researchers to identify key areas of the context-specific hidden curriculum and design thematic focus groups. At the investigation stage, student co-researchers lead focus groups to identify key elements of the hidden curriculum, feeding into quantitative data collection reaching a wider sample of the population. Finally, the analysis and targeting stage involves synthesising and interpreting results from data collection to create resources that reveal the hidden curriculum to incoming students early on in their studies. We demonstrate an application of this framework to Linguistics at Newcastle University.},

  abstract = {Machine learning algorithms are increasingly used within the digital humanities as heuristic methods in image analysis. Automated image recognition methods and the sorting of image similarities provide access to large image inventories, which are made accessible to a human eye primarily via visual distance methods. In this context, the visualisations as an interactive interface represent only one 'end product' of a dense series of both qualitative and quantitative methodological decisions within a research design. Especially these decision-making processes are the crucial points within DH research, since with them the boundaries of qualitative-image-scientific and quantitative-algorithmic approaches become perceptible. This article addresses the process of a semi-automated analysis procedure of large image data sets using Google Images on climate change as an example. It results from a case study on cross-cultural climate image comparison by the mixed-methods research team anci.[1] With the help of t-SNE as a machine learning method for dimensionality reduction and the k-means clustering method, the methodological process from data visualisation to visualization is made critically and reflectively transparent. The term pipeline serves as a metaphor for the methodological process.},

Opinion mining is the process of extracting human thoughts and perceptions from unstructured texts, which with regard to the emergence of online social media and mass volume of users' comments, has become to a useful, attractive and also challenging issue. There are varieties of researches with different trends and approaches in this area, but the lack of a comprehensive study to investigate them from all aspects is tangible. In this paper we represent a complete, multilateral and systematic review of opinion mining and sentiment analysis to classify available methods and compare their advantages and drawbacks, in order to have better understanding of available challenges and solutions to clarify the future direction. For this purpose, we present a proper framework of opinion mining accompanying with its steps and levels and then we completely monitor, classify, summarize and compare proposed techniques for aspect extraction, opinion classification, summary production and evaluation, based on the major validated scientific works. In order to have a better comparison, we also propose some factors in each category, which help to have a better understanding of advantages and disadvantages of different methods.}

In all, 226 9th graders in low academic tracks were randomly assigned to complete reader-oriented (RO), text-based (TB), or no tasks after reading literary texts to elaborate their mental text representation. Whereas RO tasks encouraged emotional engagement and indirectly stimulated text analysis through creative activities, TB tasks focused on cognitive activity and directly encouraged text analysis. After students completed the tasks, they answered test items on content- and form-related text comprehension. The results indicate that form-related comprehension improved when students elaborated their mental text representation through TB tasks. By contrast, RO students were more interested in the tasks, and they showed slightly more emotional involvement. As the two types of task instructions seemingly have different effects, they may be considered complementary elements in instructional practices for lower academic tracks.},

Equally diverse are the investigative frameworks that have been developed to study such fictional minds, their operations and qualities, and the narrative means used to portray them.The Emergence of Mindprovides new perspectives on the strategies used to represent minds in stories and suggests the variety of analytic approaches that illuminate those strategies. In this interdisciplinary and groundbreaking collection of essays, distinguished scholars such as Monika Fludernik, Alan Palmer, and Lisa Zunshine examine trends in the representation of consciousness in English-language narrative discourse from 700 to the present. Tracing commonalities and differences in the portrayal of fictional minds over virtually the entire time span during which narrative discourse in English has been written and read,The Emergence of Mindwill have a lasting impact on literary studies, narratology, and other fields.},

This is a first systematic stylometric study on this problem and a baroque hispanoamerican text. In our study, we faced building a balanced corpus from few available resources, and took extensive evaluation measures to deal with unclear stylometric signals. We use a variety of established attribution and verification methods, and introduce a novel evaluation procedure of examining historic texts with scarce corpora. The results support Sor Juana's authorship, and unravel new connections between her and other authors of the time, showing, still undermined, powerful impact of her works on the epoch. The solutions adopted in solving methodological problems of such a complex task show how stylometry can overcome similar challenges.},

Each specially commissioned chapter by both early-career and experienced international scholars surveys new conceptualizations and constitutions of audiences, and assesses key issues, themes and developments within the field. As such, this companion cements itself as an indispensable guide for students and researchers who seek a comprehensive overview and source of inspiration for a diverse range of topics in media audiences. The Routledge Companion to Media Audiences is an accessible, landmark tool which enhances our understanding of how media is utilized through advanced empirical research and methodological enquiry.

Frequency analysis of select linguistic features identifies systematic patterns of variation, 						which can be linked to the communicative functions of sub-registers. The chapter also critically reflects on the value of the 						database for corpus-based register analysis, especially on how the findings and interpretations are contingent on what 						sampling criteria are used and how the notion of (sub-)register is operationalized.},

We found that Twitter users are unlikely to be exposed to cross-ideological content from the clusters of users they followed, as these were usually politically homogeneous. Links pointed at grassroots web pages e.g.: blogs more frequently than traditional media websites. Liberal messages, however, were more likely to link to traditional media. Last, we found that more specific topics of controversy had both conservative and liberal clusters, while in broader topics, dominant clusters reflected conservative sentiment.}

  abstract = {Academic institutions are starting to recognize the growing public interest in digital humanities research, and there is an increasing demand from students for formal training in its methods. Despite the pressure on practitioners to develop innovative courses, scholarship in this area has tended to focus on research methods, theories and results rather than critical pedagogy and the actual practice of teaching. The essays in this collection offer a timely intervention in digital humanities scholarship, bringing together established and emerging scholars from a variety of humanities disciplines across the world. The first section offers views on the practical realities of teaching digital humanities at undergraduate and graduate levels, presenting case studies and snapshots of the authors' experiences alongside models for future courses and reflections on pedagogical successes and failures. The next section proposes strategies for teaching foundational digital humanities methods across a variety of scholarly disciplines, and the book concludes with wider debates about the place of digital humanities in the academy, from the field's cultural assumptions and social obligations to its political visions. Digital Humanities Pedagogy broadens the ways in which both scholars and practitioners can think about this emerging discipline, ensuring its ongoing development, vitality and long-term sustainability},

Design/methodology/approach               First, outlines the historical development of these epistemologies, by discussing and identifying basic characteristics in them and by introducing the criticism that has been raised against these views. Second, their importance for and influence in LIS have been examined.                                         Findings               The findings of this paper are that it is not a trivial matter to define those epistemologies and to characterise their influence. Many different interpretations exist and there is no consensus regarding current influence of positivism in LIS. Arguments are put forward that empiricism and positivism are still dominant within LIS and specific examples of the influence on positivism in LIS are provided. A specific analysis is made of the empiricist view of information seeking and it is shown that empiricism may be regarded as a normative theory of information seeking and knowledge organisation.                                         Originality/value               The paper discusses basic theoretical issues that are important for the further development of LIS as a scholarly field.},

GIS is typically represented as a singular, infallibly objective, and universally applicable technology. GIS generally dismisses the critiques from human geography, while critical human geography dismisses GIS for its association with positivism and unethical applications. Teaching critical open GIS may bridge this divide, creating a transformative pedagogical space for human geography to affectively and effectively engage with open GIS technology at the level of code. Critical open GIS students practice and critique GIS as conflicted insiders, bridging the divide between GIS and non-GIS in their geography education. Reviews of GIS curricula find support for teaching critical and open GIS, but reviews of texts and syllabi confirm their marginalization and separation. A new critical open GIS course is introduced, using GIS in development and political ecology as integrative frameworks.           ,              Enseigner les SIG ouverts selon une approche critique             Les programmes des {\'e}tudes sup{\'e}rieures sur les SIG marginalisent et dissocient largement l'enseignement critique des SIG et l'enseignement des SIG ouverts, mettant en parall{\`e}le un foss{\'e} entre les SIG et ce qui ne rel{\`e}ve pas des SIG en g{\'e}ographie.

It argues that this way of conceptualizing the text events of both narrative fiction and academic knowledge production provides a way of understanding and dealing with incompatible literary interpretations and also with irreconcilable approaches to literary geography. This openness to multiplicity develops from the point that text events are not only relational by nature and generated within social contexts in the initial encounter of author, text, and reader, but also only become publicly accessible when subsequently articulated within the mediating context of a particular social situation. The article proposes that literary geography as a collective endeavor can be developed and consolidated through an appreciation of the varying contexts within which geographically oriented work with fiction is performed and articulated.}

On the one hand, where fundamental literary concepts such as author, text, and reader might once have been taken for granted as obvious and unproblematic by geographers, they are now being understood in more complex terms; on the other hand, spatial concepts such as place, space, scale, and distance, which might once have seemed quite straightforward to nongeographers, are now being interrogated within literary studies. Previously, for example, geographers working with literary texts tended to concentrate primarily on the complexities of geographical themes and terms and spatial theory, while paying less attention to the constantly evolving complexities of themes, methods, and theory in literary criticism. This worked the other way around for literary critics. As work in literary geography has become more multidisciplinary, however, more geographers have begun to work seriously with literary criticism and narrative theory, and more literary scholars have begun to engage with work in geography and spatial theory; as a result, the distinction between disciplines and specializations is becoming far less fixed. Today, terms relating to literary texts that are contested and complex within literary studies but would previously have been considered rather straightforward by nonspecialists are being given more consideration by geographers; similarly, terms relating to geographical themes are being thought through more carefully by literary critics.},

It addresses important issues in each of the three major literary genres, and intentionally applies different techniques and concepts to poetry, prose, and drama. It aims to present a provocative and suggestive sample intended to encourage the application of these and other methods to literary studies. Hoover, Culpeper, and O'Halloran push the methods, techniques, and concepts in new directions, apply them to new groups of texts or to new questions, modify their nature or method of application, and combine them in innovative ways. {\copyright} 2014 Taylor \& Francis.

  abstract = {Abstract Eye-tracking parameters (fixation and pupillary responses) have been shown to be modulated by the aesthetic perception and evaluation of visual and auditory artworks (e.g., paintings, music). The present study investigated whether similar effects can be found in visual text processing. Participants read four groups of short sentences in which a key predictor of aesthetic liking, i.e., familiarity, was systematically modified to four degrees. Across all four groups, the sentences moreover varied with regard to featuring or not featuring meter. During reading, pupil sizes and eye movements were recorded. Aesthetic ratings of all sentences were collected afterwards, and the relationships between the ratings, levels of familiarity, meter, and eye-tracking datasets were tested. The results showed that the rating scores were interactively modulated by both familiarity-driven and meter-driven fluency. Using factor analysis, we extracted two key factors of the aesthetic appeal of the texts: an affective and a cognitive factor. The cognitive factor comprised the rating items ``succinctness'' and ``familiarity,'' whereas the affective factor reflected the ratings for ``beauty'' and ``liking.'' A higher cognitive factor predicted shorter dwelling time. Moreover, the two factors modulated the pupillary data antagonistically: A higher affective factor predicted larger pupil dilations, whereas a higher cognitive factor predicted smaller pupil dilations. The study shows a possible application of the eye-tracking method for capturing aesthetically evaluative dimensions of processing sentences.}

  abstract = {Text analytics are well-known in the modern era for extracting information and patterns from text. However, no study has attempted to illustrate the pattern and priorities of newspaper headlines in Bangladesh using a combination of text analytics techniques. The purpose of this paper is to examine the pattern of words that appeared on the front page of a well-known daily English newspaper in Bangladesh, The Daily Star, in 2018 and 2019. The elucidation of that era's possible social and political context was also attempted using word patterns. The study employs three widely used and contemporary text mining techniques: word clouds, sentiment analysis, and cluster analysis. The word cloud reveals that election, kill, cricket, and Rohingya-related terms appeared more than 60 times in 2018, whereas BNP, poll, kill, AL, and Khaleda appeared more than 80 times in 2019. These indicated the country's passion for cricket, political turmoil, and Rohingya-related issues. Furthermore, sentiment analysis reveals that words of fear and negative emotions appeared more than 600 times, whereas anger, anticipation, sadness, trust, and positive-type emotions came up more than 400 times in both years. Finally, the clustering method demonstrates that election, politics, deaths, digital security act, Rohingya, and cricket-related words exhibit similarity and belong to a similar group in 2019, whereas rape, deaths, road, and fire-related words clustered in 2018 alongside a similar-appearing group. In general, this analysis demonstrates how vividly the text mining approach depicts Bangladesh's social, political, and law-and-order situation, particularly during election season and the country's cricket craze, and also validates the significance of the text mining approach to understanding the overall view of a country during a particular time in an efficient manner.},

  abstract = {Immersion in reading, described as a feeling of 'getting lost in a book', is a ubiquitous phenomenon widely appreciated by readers. However, it has been largely ignored in cognitive neuroscience. According to the fiction feeling hypothesis, narratives with emotional contents invite readers more to be empathic with the protagonists and thus engage the affective empathy network of the brain, the anterior insula and mid-cingulate cortex, than do stories with neutral contents. To test the hypothesis, we presented participants with text passages from the Harry Potter series in a functional MRI experiment and collected post-hoc immersion ratings, comparing the neural correlates of passage mean immersion ratings when reading fear-inducing versus neutral contents. Results for the conjunction contrast of baseline brain activity of reading irrespective of emotional content against baseline were in line with previous studies on text comprehension. In line with the fiction feeling hypothesis, immersion ratings were significantly higher for fear-inducing than for neutral passages, and activity in the mid-cingulate cortex correlated more strongly with immersion ratings of fear-inducing than of neutral passages. Descriptions of protagonists' pain or personal distress featured in the fear-inducing passages apparently caused increasing involvement of the core structure of pain and affective empathy the more readers immersed in the text. The predominant locus of effects in the mid-cingulate cortex seems to reflect that the immersive experience was particularly facilitated by the motor component of affective empathy for our stimuli from the Harry Potter series featuring particularly vivid descriptions of the behavioural aspects of emotion.},

Thus, a method was developed in which participants listened to stories while wearing a head-mounted eyetracker.

This article aims to explore the potential of digital humanities in advancing literary research through critical practices and elucidates the distinctive advantages of employing digital humanities methodologies in the study of literature. In this article, a dozen of children's editions of Robinson Crusoe from different historical periods are used as the corpus, and methods such as word cloud, keyword extraction, and sentiment analysis using Python are used to examine the adaptation of Defoe's original novel in children's editions and to uncover a positive inclination throughout the diachronic evolution of children's literature adaptations. It has also revealed some patterns within the intricate details of the different children's editions. In doing so, the article demonstrates the unique advantages of digital humanities in literary studies and proposes new ways of applying digital humanities to literary criticism.},

How does one empirically evaluate the effectiveness of a visualization environment? I argue that choosing an approach is a matter of finding the right perspective for viewing human use of the visualization environment. This chapter presents three alternative perspectives---Cognitive, Social, and Cultural---each of which is distinguished by its own intellectual tradition and guiding theory. In so doing, the chapter has three broad goals: (a) to illustrate that different research traditions and perspectives lead to different definitions of effectiveness; (b) to show that, depending upon the research questions of interest and the situations in which a visualization environment is being used, each perspective can prove more or less useful in approaching the empirical evaluation of the environment; and (c) to provide visualization researchers with a repertoire of evaluation methods to draw from, and guidelines for matching research methods to research questions of interest.},

According to Statista, there were 4.59 billion users of social media worldwide in 2022 and expected to grow up to 5.85 billion in the year 2027. With its massive user base, social media does not only generate useful information for businesses and individuals, but at the same time, it also creates an abundance of misinformation and disinformation as well as malinformation to acquire social-political or business agendas. Individuals tend to share social media posts without checking the authenticity of the information they are sharing, which results in posts having misinformation, disinformation, or malinformation becoming viral around the world in a matter of minutes.

Eye tracking is used to study basic reading processes and syntactic parsing, but there are few studies where eye tracking is employed to examine global text processing. As one moves from the study of lexical processing to syntactic processing, the potential units of analysis increase in both number and size. There are four relevant levels of processing in the study of syntactic processing: (1) the word at which a parsing choice is expected to be made or a syntactic ambiguity to reveal itself, (2) the phrase, (3) the clause, and (4) the whole sentence. Related to the increase in the number and size of potentially interesting units of analysis, the mental processing associated with syntactic processes is more complex and varied than the mental processing associated with lexical processing. Thus, syntactic effects on eye movements are correspondingly more complex than lexical effects on eye movements.},

It is argued that global eye movement measures indexing attentional and encoding processes during the entire learning period should preferably be complemented with more fine-grained analyses that are either time-locked to important events taking place in an animation or that by other means provide information about the time course of learning. As nicely documented in the present set of studies, it is also of importance to complement the eye-tracking data with offline measures indexing the end product of learning. Such a complementary approach is likely to yield important new insights into the process of multimedia learning.},

The frequency of the head noun in modifier-head compound words was manipulated to tap into the degree of compositional processing.

Based on the dual-route race model (Pollatsek et al., 2000) and the visual acuity principle (Bertram \& Hy{\"o}n{\"a}, 2003), long lexicalized and novel compound words were predicted to be processed via the decomposition route and short lexicalized compound words via the holistic route. Gaze duration and selective regression-path duration demonstrated a constituent frequency effect of similar size for long lexicalized and novel compound words. For short compound words the constituent frequency effect was negligible for lexicalized words but robust for novel words. The results are consistent with the visual acuity principle that assumes long novel compound words to be recognized via the decomposition route and short lexicalized compound words via the holistic route.}

This study compares prototypical FIS/FIT cases with those which are ambiguous between narration and either one of these forms (N-FIS/N-FIT cases) and tries to specify the textual/contextual elements which differentiate straightforward FIS/FIT and N-FIS/N-FIT ambiguities. The analysis, which is based on the data of the Lancaster Speech, Writing and Thought Presentation (SW\&TP) corpus, shows that the management of viewpoint is the key to distinguishing straightforward FIS/FIT from ambiguous cases. It also suggests that N-FIS and N-FIT ambiguities with narration can have different effects on the reader's understanding of the textual worlds compared with prototypical FIS/FIT cases.}

  abstract = {The narrative world of Woolf?s To the Lighthouse (1992 [1927]) is primarily composed of its characters? thought and speech presentation. One character?s flow of thoughts is connected with another character?s thoughts, and viewpoint shifts occur very quickly and frequently. This article analyses how the two connectives ?but? and ?for? contribute to viewpoint shifting by comparing their stylistic, pragmatic functions in contexts where similar types of viewpoint shifting occur. Adopting a corpus-assisted approach, sentences and clauses before and after ?but? and ?for? are compared when these sentences and clauses are identified as being in similar discourse presentation categories such as free direct thought and direct speech. ?But? emphasizes the distinction between the narration and a character?s discourse or between two characters? discourse, whereas ?for? helps viewpoint shifting to take place more implicitly, as a result of which the boundary between the different voices tends to be blurred.}

In this context, the digital will not be understood as merely something that is linked to specific tools and objects, but rather as different modes of thought. For example, the digital within the humanities is not just databases and big data, topic modelling and speculative visualizations; nor are the objects limited to computer games, other electronic works, or to literature and art that explicitly relate to computerization or other digital aspects. In what way do digital tools and expressions in the 1960s differ to the ubiquitous systems of our time? What kind of artistic effects does this generate? Is the present theoretical fascination for materiality an effect or a reaction to a digitization? Above all: how can early modern forms such as the cabinets of curiosity, emblem books and the archival principle of pertinence contribute to the analyses of contemporary digital forms?},

However, when the sums of the individual fixations on a word were computed, there was a consistent tendency toward a mask {\texttimes} predictability interaction, while the mask again combined additively with word frequency. It is argued that the on-line processing of individual words becomes increasingly differentiated as postlexical processing becomes implicated.},

Despite a wealth of literature published in specialized journals like Poetics, however, still little is known about how the brain processes and creates literary and poetic texts. Still, such stimulus material might be suited better than other genres for demonstrating the complexities with which our brain constructs the world in and around us, because it unifies thought and language, music and imagery in a clear, manageable way, most often with play, pleasure, and emotion (Schrott and Jacobs, 2011). In this paper, I discuss methods and models for investigating the neuronal and cognitive-affective bases of literary reading together with pertinent results from studies on poetics, text processing, emotion, or neuroaesthetics, and outline current challenges and future perspectives.},

Applying such mixed analyses we tested three hypotheses derived from the Neurocognitive Poetics Model of literary reading (Jacobs, 2011, 2015a, 2015b): (a) the multilevel hypothesis stating that textual features at four relevant levels of textual analysis (supralexical, interlexical, lexical and sublexical) affect empathic/immersive and aesthetic-liking processes of poetry reception at all three levels of measurement (experiential, peripheral-physiological, and behavioral); (b) the mood empathy hypothesis stating that poems expressing moods of persons, atmospheres, situations, or objects should engage readers to mentally simulate and affectively resonate with the depicted state of affairs (see also L{\"u}dtke et al., 2014); and (c) the aesthetic trajectory hypothesis stating that poems with a high amount of foregrounding facilitate aesthetic liking responses. The results are in line with all three hypotheses and raise a number of questions for future research on poetry reception.},

We discuss the Neurocognitive Poetics Model (Jacobs, 2015a) of literary reading specifying the likely neuronal correlates of several key processes in literary reading, namely inference and situation model building, immersion, mental simulation and imagery, figurative language and style, and the issue of distinguishing fact from fiction. An overview of recent work on these key processes is followed by a discussion of methodological challenges in studying the brain bases of fiction processing.}

In contrast to other established tools, SentiArt is based on publicly available vector space models (VSMs) and requires no emotional dictionary, thus making it applicable in any language for which VSMs have been made available ({$>$}150 so far) and avoiding issues of low coverage. In a first study, the AAP values of all words of a widely used lexical databank for German were computed and the VSM's ability in representing concrete and more abstract semantic concepts was demonstrated. In a second study, SentiArt was used to predict {\textasciitilde}2800 human word valence ratings and shown to have a high predictive accuracy (R2 {$>$} 0.5, p {$<$} 0.0001). A third study tested the validity of SentiArt in predicting emotional states over (narrative) time using human liking ratings from reading a story. Again, the predictive accuracy was highly significant: R2adj = 0.46, p {$<$} 0.0001, establishing the SentiArt tool as a promising candidate for lexical sentiment analyses at both the micro- and macrolevels, i.e., short and long literary materials. Possibilities and limitations of lexical VSM-based sentiment analyses of diverse complex literary texts are discussed in the light of these results.},

The tool uses vector space models together with theory-guided, empirically validated label lists to compute the valence of each word in a text by locating its position in a 2d emotion potential space spanned by the {$>$} 2 million words of the vector space model. After testing the tool's accuracy with empirical data from a neurocognitive study, it was applied to compute emotional figure profiles and personality figure profiles (inspired by the so-called {\quotesinglbase}big five' personality theory) for main characters from the book series. The results of comparative analyses using different machine-learning classifiers (e.g., AdaBoost, Neural Net) show that SentiArt performs very well in predicting the emotion potential of text passages. It also produces plausible predictions regarding the emotional and personality profile of fiction characters which are correctly identified on the basis of eight character features, and it achieves a good cross-validation accuracy in classifying 100 figures into `good' vs. `bad' ones. The results are discussed with regard to potential applications of SentiArt in digital literary, applied reading and neurocognitive poetics studies such as the quantification of the hybrid hero potential of figures.},

  abstract = {Abstract Eye tracking has helped to understand the process of reading a word or a sentence, and this research has been very fruitful over the past decades. However, everyday real?world reading dramatically differs from this scenario: we read a newspaper on the bus, surf the Internet for movie reviews or browse folders at work to fill in forms. Therefore, we propose to structure eye?tracking research in reading into three levels of reading: level 1 research on reading to investigate single words or sentences, level 2 research on reading and comprehending a whole text and level 3 research on reading and processing involving several text documents. The present Special Section includes three articles investigating real?world reading on levels 2 and 3. These articles show how real?world reading can be investigated by means of eye tracking and complementary methods, to understand how we read, comprehend and integrate texts in realistic, everyday scenarios. Such new research lines broaden our knowledge of reading itself.}

The approach is applied to a current version of the HeLI language identification method, which is now called HeLI 2.0. We describe the HeLI 2.0 method in detail. The resulting system is evaluated using the datasets from the German dialect identification and Indo-Aryan language identification shared tasks of the VarDial workshops 2017 and 2018. The new approach with LM adaptation provides considerably higher F1-scores than the basic HeLI or HeLI 2.0 methods or the other systems which participated in the shared tasks. The results indicate that unsupervised LM adaptation should be considered as an option in all language identification tasks, especially in those where encountering out-of-domain data is likely.},

This is extended by a focal analysis, which demonstrates how corpus tools can be effectively adopted to explore discursive practices of new forms of digital advertising. For the purpose of the focal analysis, a small corpus of native ads sourced from BuzzFeed was created. BuzzFeed is a global digital news platform which was created in the United States in 2006. The focus is on native ads. Native ads were selected after browsing the BuzzFeed website. The chapter concludes with observations regarding opportunities and limitations of a corpus-based discourse analysis to study advertising and discusses avenues for future research.},

The generated plots show that in a particular scene, two characters can share multiple emotions together with different intensity. Furthermore, the directionality of the emotion can be captured as well, depending on which character is more dominant in each interaction. EMOFIEL provides a web-based GUI that allows users to query the annotated stories to explore the emotion mapping of a given character pair throughout a given story, and to explore scenes for which a certain emotion peaks.},

These tests are performed using two separate feature sets: a ``raw'' feature set containing all words and word bigrams that are common to all of the authors, and a second ``pre-processed'' feature set derived by reducing the raw feature set to include only words meeting a minimum relative frequency threshold. Each of the methods tested performed well, but nearest shrunken centroids and regularized discriminant analysis had the best overall performances with 0/70 cross-validation errors.}

Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature provides a practical introduction to computational text analysis using the open source programming language R. R is extremely popular throughout the sciences and because of its accessibility, R is now used increasingly in other research areas. Readers begin working with text right away and each chapter works through a new technique or process such that readers gain a broad exposure to core R procedures and a basic understanding of the possibilities of computational text analysis at both the micro and macro scale. Each chapter builds on the previous as readers move from small scale "microanalysis" of single texts to large scale "macroanalysis" of text corpora, and each chapter concludes with a set of practice exercises that reinforce and expand upon the chapter lessons. The book's focus is on making the technical palatable and making the technical useful and immediately gratifying},

This chapter explores the philosophy, execution and utility of popular sentiment lexicons and datasets. We describe different labelling schemes that may be used. We then provide a detailed description of existing sentiment and emotion lexicons, and the trends underlying research in lexicon generation. This is followed by a survey of sentiment-annotated datasets and the nuances of labelling involved. We then show how lexicons and datasets created for one language can be transferred to a new language. Finally, we place these sentiment resources in the perspective of their classic applications to sentiment analysis.},

  abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter deals with the compound words that present an opportunity to study the organization of the mental lexicon. Recording readers' eye movements has been a particularly useful way to study the word recognition process. Numerous studies have demonstrated that characteristics of the word currently being fixated affect its reading time, such as the word's frequency or familiarity, age-of-acquisition, concreteness, and length. Decomposition of compound words occurs in multiple languages. Most studies of compound words have used semantically transparent compounds. It is therefore difficult to localize the level at which decomposition occurs. This chapter explores the role of semantic transparency for English compound words. Transparent and opaque compounds were embedded into sentences and the frequencies of their lexemes were manipulated. Analysis of gaze durations revealed main effects of lexeme frequency and transparency. Transparency did not interact with lexeme frequency, suggesting decomposition occurs for both transparent and opaque compounds. The finding that the frequency of both lexemes influences gaze durations and that these effects do not interact with the transparency of the compound suggests that both transparent and opaque compound words are decomposed in a similar fashion during the early stages of recognition.},

  abstract = {The remarkable progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) brought about by deep learning, particularly with the recent advent of large pre-trained neural language models, is brought into scrutiny as several studies began to discuss and report potential biases in NLP applications. Bias in NLP is found to originate from latent historical biases encoded by humans into textual data which gets perpetuated or even amplified by NLP algorithm. We present a survey to comprehend bias in large pre-trained language models, analyze the stages at which they occur in these models, and various ways in which these biases could be quantified and mitigated. Considering wide applicability of textual affective computing based downstream tasks in real-world systems such as business, healthcare, education, etc., we give a special emphasis on investigating bias in the context of affect (emotion) i.e., Affective Bias, in large pre-trained language models. We present a summary of various bias evaluation corpora that help to aid future research and discuss challenges in the research on bias in pre-trained language models. We believe that our attempt to draw a comprehensive view of bias in pre-trained language models, and especially the exploration of affective bias will be highly beneficial to researchers interested in this evolving field.},

Sixty-two participants read either a high or a low prior knowledge (HPK vs. LPK) text twice from a given perspective while their eye movements were recorded. They switched perspective before a third reading. Reading perspective affected the first-pass reading and also increased sentence wrap-up processing time in the perspective-relevant sentences. Prior knowledge facilitated the recognition of the (ir)relevance of text information and resulted in relatively earlier perspective effects in the HPK versus LPK text. Repeated reading facilitated processing, as indicated by all eye movement measures. After the perspective switch, a repetition benefit was observed for the previously relevant text information, whereas a repetition cost was found for the previously irrelevant text information. These results indicate that reading perspective and prior knowledge have a significant influence on how readers allocate visual attention during reading.}

This paper presents a study and analysis of differences of approaches used for Emotion Detection and Sentiment Analysis for both cases. In this study, 10 formal text pieces in form of poetry, proverbs, essay and document are analyzed. These text pieces are present in 7 different International languages (i.e. Persian, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, Malaysian, English, Ottoman). Informal text, in form of chats, emails, review sites and micro blogs, written in different International languages (Korean, Persian and English) are considered in this study. Various machine learning based methods -Support Vector Machine(SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree are more often used in classification of literary arts especially poetry. Statistical Machine learning approach Support Vector Machine outperforms all other methods in case of poetry and NB performed well in case of Informal Writing Style.}

The conclusion discusses the strengths and shortcomings of the examined techniques and suggests possible ways to further improve tagging and parsing accuracy.}

This accessible volume is the first comprehensive multidisciplinary work to explore these processes through the perspective of scholars working outside of Anglo-American paradigms.

Bringing diverse viewpoints from across the globe and from a range of disciplines, including anthropology, economics, history, political science, sociology, and Science \& Technology Studies (STS), this wide-ranging and thought-provoking collection offers a broad and cutting-edge overview of outstanding research on academic knowledge circulation. The book is structured in seven sections: (i) key concepts in studying the circulation of academic knowledge; (ii) spaces and actors of circulation; (iii) academic media and knowledge circulation; (iv) the political economy of academic knowledge circulation; (v) the geographies, geopolitics and historical legacies of the global circulation of academic knowledge; (vi) the relationships between academic and extra-academic knowledges; and (vii) methodological approaches to studying the circulation of academic knowledge. This handbook will be essential reading for academics, researchers and postgraduate researchers in the humanities and social sciences interested in the circulation of knowledge"--},

I turn to Toni Morrison's novel               Beloved               to track black cartographic practices otherwise obscured or, as Katherine McKittrick writes, ``rendered ungeographic''. The novel offers a hidden and unauthorised archive for the often clandestine geographic practices that make possible fugitivity from the mechanics of ``slaveholding agro-capitalism'' and its ongoing legacy. As an unofficial archive of black geographic practice, Morrison's novel might itself be thought of as a map: a contemporary mode of memorialising the depth of place, relation, and navigation---a depth no two-dimensional map can accommodate. Finally, this article demonstrates the valuable interventions that black studies and black creative production can make within the subfields of critical cartography and critical geography.},

I describe two distinct kinds of meanings associated with -self, namely emphatic and reflexive -self, and show that each of these is associated with a closely related configuration involving a `viewpoint'. I then consider the viewpoint uses of -self in terms of the semantic parameter of subjectivity, in the sense of Langacker (1990), and relate it to other current notions of subjectivity.In the following analysis, crucial reference is made to the notion of referential accessibility, a discourse concept developed by Ariel (1988, 1990) and very similar to the theoretical framework elaborated by Giv{\'o}n (1983) under the name `topic continuity'. Accessibility can be denned as the degree of ease with which a discourse referent can be identified or `picked out' mentally via the use of a given referring element (with `referring' understood in a broad sense including mental conceptions of any degree of specificity or definiteness). The fundamental claim of Accessibility Theory is that `referring expressions are no more than guidelines for retrievals' (Ariel 1988:68), and thus the inherent semantics of each type of expression is the very processing procedure by which the referent is accessed. Referring expressions fall along a cline of degree of accessibility, from low accessibility signals like full, elaborated noun phrases, to high accessibility markers like pronouns and zero anaphora. The linguistic element of concern in this chapter, -self, is, as we will see, a marker of high accessibility.},

We identify two large groups of measures that behave differently, but consistently. The effect of sampling frequency on these two groups of measures are explored and simulations are performed to estimate how much data are required to overcome the uncertainty of a limited sampling frequency. Both simulated and real data are used to estimate the temporal uncertainty of data produced by low sampling frequencies. The aim is to provide easy-to-use heuristics for researchers using eye-tracking. For example, we show how to compensate the uncertainty of a low sampling frequency with more data and postexperiment adjustments of measures. These findings have implications primarily for researchers using naturalistic setups where sampling frequencies typically are low.},

We concentrate on the analysis of scientific documents, distribution of subject categories, languages of documents and languages that have been more investigated in sentiment analysis, most prolific and impactful authors and institutions, venues of publications and their geographic distribution, most cited and hot documents, trends of keywords and future works. Our investigations demonstrate that the most frequent subject categories in this field are computer science, engineering, telecommunications, linguistics, operations research and management science, information science and library science, business and economics, automation and control systems, robotics and social sciences. In addition, the most active venue of publication in this field is Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). The United States, China and Singapore have the most prolific or impactful institutions. A keyword analysis demonstrates that sentiment analysis is a more accepted term than opinion mining. Twitter is the most used social network for sentiment analysis and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is the most used classification method. We also present the most cited and hot documents in this field and authors? suggestions for future works.}

In our study, we leverage projects from an institution-sponsored Justice, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (JEDI) initiative as notional `Trojan horses' to instil within university students a more reflexive awareness of responsibility that they can take with them when they graduate. In delivering this positive hidden (extra)curriculum, staff are seemingly performing the formal agenda of the institution's responsibility agenda while undermining its managerialist hidden curriculum by working in tandem with students. Our key findings -- student reflection and voice -- are evidence of the positive hidden curriculum implementation. Our contributions are twofold. First, we demonstrate that positive hidden curricula can serve as a tool of micro-activism to subvert managerialist hidden curricula. Second, we offer another dimension to Semper and Blasco's interpersonal strategies for challenging the hidden curriculum by showing that collaborative projects between students and staff can be sites of a positive hidden (extra)curriculum. Collaborative initiatives such as the ones we describe in this article provide a tangible foundation for reconsidering creative and intrinsic approaches to responsible learning environments.},

The currently predominant view is that literary fiction---often described as narratives that focus on in-depth portrayals of subjects\&\#039; inner feelings and thoughts---can be linked to theory of mind processes, especially those that are involved in the understanding or simulation of the affective characteristics of the subjects. Kidd and Castano (p. 377, published online 3 October) provide experimental evidence that reading passages of literary fiction, in comparison to nonfiction or popular fiction, does indeed enhance the reader\&\#039;s performance on theory of mind tasks. Understanding others' mental states is a crucial skill that enables the complex social relationships that characterize human societies. Yet little research has investigated what fosters this skill, which is known as Theory of Mind (ToM), in adults. We present five experiments showing that reading literary fiction led to better performance on tests of affective ToM (experiments 1 to 5) and cognitive ToM (experiments 4 and 5) compared with reading nonfiction (experiments 1), popular fiction (experiments 2 to 5), or nothing at all (experiments 2 and 5). Specifically, these results show that reading literary fiction temporarily enhances ToM. More broadly, they suggest that ToM may be influenced by engagement with works of art.}

Socialization practices and interpersonal interactions help develop this capacity, and so does engaging with fiction. Research suggests that lifetime exposure to fiction predicts performance on ToM tests, but little evidence speaks to the type of fiction most responsible for this effect. We draw from literary theory and empirical work to propose that literary fiction is more likely than genre fiction to foster ToM, describe the development of a new method for assessing exposure to literary and popular genre fiction, and report findings from 3 samples testing the specificity of the relation between exposure to literary fiction and ToM. Results indicate that exposure to literary but not genre fiction positively predicts performance on a test of ToM, even when accounting for demographic variables including age, gender, educational attainment, undergraduate major (in 2 samples), and self-reported empathy (in 1 sample). These findings offer further evidence that habitual engagement with others' minds, even fictional ones, may improve the psychological processes supporting intersubjectivity. We discuss their implications for understanding the impacts of fiction, and for models of culture more generally.}

Three preregistered experiments revealed mixed results. Applying the "small telescopes" method developed by Simonsohn revealed two uninformative failures to replicate and one successful replication. On a measure of the importance of intentions to moral judgments, results were more mixed, with one significant effect in the expected direction, one non-significant effect, and one significant effect in the unexpected direction. In addition, two experiments yielded support for the exploratory but preregistered hypothesis that characters in popular fiction are perceived as more predictable and stereotypic than those in literary fiction. These findings help clarify the sociocognitive effects of reading literary fiction and refine questions for future research.}

Regarding these central issues, this study has three goals: i) to conduct a comprehensive literature review and examine these issues qualitatively, with the aid of corpora (ICE-GB and COHA used); ii) to provide some insight and resolutions, if possible, to each issue, iii) to expand the horizons of delineating the identity of that relative clauses more comprehensively than before. With the comprehensive literature review and corpus research, this study attempts to resolve and provide some solutions and suggestions to this conundrum. Finally, this study expands the horizons of delineating the identity of that relative clauses more comprehensively, so that it can be helpful in subsequent research.},

To fill this gap, we investigated 368 first graders' oral and silent reading using eye-tracking technology at the beginning and end of the school year. Oral reading took a longer time (greater rereading times and refixations) than silent reading, but showed greater development (greater reduction in rereading times and fixations) from the beginning to the end of the year. The relation of eye-movement behaviors to reading proficiency was such that, for example, less rereading time was positively related to reading proficiency, and the relation was stronger in oral reading than in silent reading. Moreover, the nature of relations between eye movements and reading skill varied as a function of the child's reading proficiency such that the relations were weaker for poor readers, particularly at the beginning of the year. The relations between eye movements and reading proficiency stabilized in the spring for children whose reading skill was 0.30 quantile and above, but weaker relations remained for readers below 0.30 quantile. These findings suggest the importance of examining eye-movement behaviors in both oral and silent reading modes and their developmental relations to reading proficiency.},

Comparing the term "transmedia" with "transnational," they show that the movement beyond specific media or nations does not invalidate those entities but makes us look more closely at the cultural specificity of each combination. In two parts, the book stages debates across essays, creating dialogues that give different narrative accounts of what is historically and ideologically at stake in medium specificity and digital politics. Each part includes a substantive introduction by one of the editors.Part 1 examines precursors, contemporary theorists, and artists who are protagonists in this discursive drama, focusing on how the transmedia frictions and continuities between old and new forms can be read most productively: N. Katherine Hayles and Lev Manovich redefine medium specificity, Edward Branigan and Yuri Tsivian explore nondigital precursors, Steve Anderson and Stephen Mamber assess contemporary archival histories, and Grahame Weinbren and Caroline Bassett defend the open-ended mobility of newly emergent media.In part 2, trios of essays address various ideologies of the digital: John Hess and Patricia R. Zimmerman, Herman Gray, and David Wade Crane redraw contours of race, space, and the margins; Eric Gordon, Cristina Venegas, and John T. Caldwell unearth database cities, portable homelands, and virtual fieldwork; and Mark B.N.

We use the dataset to examine 219 automatic sentiment analysis systems that took part in a recent shared task, SemEval-2018 Task 1 'Affect in Tweets'.

While the underlying techniques are traditional---Na{\"i}ve Bayes, SVM---literary criticism, and the ``digital humanities'' more generally, differ from other domains in that they rarely admit ground truth into their discussions. Instead, data mining and machine learning are best understood in terms of ``provocation''---the potential for outlier results to surprise a reader into attending to some aspect of a text not previously deemed significant---as well as ``notreading'' or ``distant reading,'' the automated search for patterns across a much wider corpus than could be read and assimilated via traditional humanistic methods of ``close reading.'' At a moment when a widely publicized report by the National Endowment for the Arts concluded reading itself was ``at risk,'' large online text collections (Google Books, the Open Content Alliance) are making millions of texts available in machine-readable form.

  abstract = {"The story of writing in the digital age is every bit as messy as the ink-stained rags that littered the floor of Gutenberg's print shop or the hot molten lead of the linotype machine. During the period of the pivotal growth and widespread adoption of word processing as a writing technology, some authors embraced it as a marvel while others decried it as the death of literature. The product of years of archival research and numerous interviews conducted by the author, Track Changes is the first literary history of word processing. Matthew Kirschenbaum examines how the interests and ideals of creative authorship came to coexist with the computer revolution. Who were the first adopters? What kind of anxieties did they share? Was word processing perceived as just a better typewriter or something more? How did it change our understanding of writing? Track Changes balances the stories of individual writers with a consideration of how the seemingly ineffable act of writing is always grounded in particular instruments and media, from quills to keyboards. Along the way, we discover the candidates for the first novel written on a word processor, explore the surprisingly varied reasons why writers of both popular and serious literature adopted the technology, trace the spread of new metaphors and ideas from word processing in fiction and poetry, and consider the fate of literary scholarship and memory in an era when the final remnants of authorship may consist of folders on a hard drive or documents in the cloud."--Provided by publisher},

Using EEG event-related potentials (ERPs), the present study examines the functional stage(s) of this differentiation. Positive, negative, and neutral nouns were randomly mixed with pseudowords and letter strings derived from words within each valence and presented for reading while participants' EEG was recorded. Results indicated emotion effects in the N1 (110--140ms), early posterior negativity (EPN, 216--320) and late positive potential (LPP, 432--500ms) time windows. Across valence, orthographic word-form effects occurred from about 180ms after stimulus presentation. Crucially, in emotional words, lexicality effects (real words versus pseudowords) were identified from 216ms, words being more negative over posterior cortex, coinciding with EPN effects, whereas neutral words differed from pseudowords only after 320ms. Emotional content affects word processing at pre-lexical, lexical and post-lexical levels, but remarkably lexical access to emotional words is faster than access to neutral words.},

  abstract = {In recent years, scholars from across the humanities, including literary critics Stephen Best and Saidiya Hartman, have theorized about how best to account for the silences endemic to the archive of American slavery. These critics call for a shift away from what Best has described as a ``logic and ethic of recovery'' to a new focus, instead, on animating the mysteries of the past. With the example of James Hemings, Thomas Jefferson's enslaved chef (and Sally Hemings's older brother), this essay shows how a set of techniques associated with the digital humanities---in particular, techniques that derive from the fields of computational linguistics and data visualization---can further illuminate these mysteries. It also describes how the unique demands of the archive of slavery pose challenges to the field of digital humanities as it is currently conceived. By contrasting a set of visualizations of Hemings's archival trace with Jefferson's own charts and tables, Klein demonstrates how we must rethink the empiricist epistemology of the visible that endures to this day. After a brief discussion of data visualization as it relates to the construction of race, Klein turns to the issue of labor, and concludes that Hemings's culinary labor, when considered as techne, can inform discussions of digital labor today.},

Here we illustrate this approach with two-rectangle cueing in visual attention (Egly et al., 1994). We replicated previous experimental cue-validity effects relating to a spatial shift of attention within an object (spatial effect), to attention switch between objects (object effect), and to the attraction of attention toward the display centroid (attraction effect), also taking into account the design-inherent imbalance of valid and other trials. We simultaneously estimated variance/covariance components of subject-related random effects for these spatial, object, and attraction effects in addition to their mean reaction times (RTs). The spatial effect showed a strong positive correlation with mean RT and a strong negative correlation with the attraction effect. The analysis of individual differences suggests that slow subjects engage attention more strongly at the cued location than fast subjects. We compare this joint LMM analysis of experimental effects and associated subject-related variances and correlations with two frequently used alternative statistical procedures.}

The contributors to this volume - linguists, anthropologists, cognitive scientists, and others - adopt a modern Darwinian perspective which offers a bold synthesis of the human and natural sciences. As a feature of human social intelligence, language evolution is driven by biologically anomalous levels of social cooperation. Phonetic competence correspondingly reflects social pressures for vocal imitation, learning, and other forms of social transmission. Distinctively human social and cultural strategies gave rise to the complex syntactical structure of speech. This book, presenting language as a remarkable social adaptation, testifies to the growing influence of evolutionary thinking in contemporary linguistics. It will be welcomed by all those interested in human evolution, evolutionary psychology, linguistic anthropology, and general linguistics.},

  abstract = {Sentiment analysis is a popular research area devoted to methods allowing automatic analysis of the subjectivity in textual content. Many of these methods are based on the using of machine learning and they usually depend on manually annotated training corpora. However, the creation of corpora is a time-consuming task, which leads to necessity of methods facilitating this process. Methods of active learning, aimed at the selection of the most informative examples according to the given classification task, can be utilized in order to increase the effectiveness of the annotation. Currently it is a lack of systematical research devoted to the application of active learning in the creation of corpora for sentiment analysis. Hence, the aim of this work is to survey some of the active learning strategies applicable in annotation tools used in the context of sentiment analysis. We evaluated compared strategies on the domain of product reviews. The results of experiments confirmed the increase of the corpus quality in terms of higher classification accuracy achieved on the test set for most of the evaluated strategies (more than 20\% higher accuracy in comparison to the random strategy).},

The robust variance estimation (RVE)- based meta-analysis models were employed, followed by four different RVE meta-regression models to examine the potential effects of some of the covariates (moderators) on the mean differences in comprehension and reading speed between reading on screen and reading on paper. The RVE meta-analysis showed that reading on paper was better than reading on screen in terms of reading comprehension, and there were no significant differences between reading on paper and reading on screen in terms of reading speed. None of the moderators were significant at the 0.05 level. In the meanwhile, albeit not significant, examination of the p-values for the difference tests prior to 2013 and after 2013 respectively (not shown here) indicated that the magnitude of the difference in reading comprehension between paper and screen followed a diminishing trajectory. It was suggested that future meta-analyses include latest studies, and other potential moderators such as fonts, spacing, age and gender.}

  abstract = {This study investigated the effects of foregrounding on affective responses (i.e., emotions) during reading, and on empathy and reflection after reading, using both quantitative and qualitative measures. In addition, the influence of personal factors (trait empathy, personal experience, exposure to literature) on empathy and reflection was explored. Participants (N = 142) were randomly assigned to read 1 of 3 versions of an excerpt from a literary novel about the loss of a child. Versions differed in the level of foregrounded textual features: the ``original'' version possessed a high level of semantic, phonetic, and grammatical foregrounding; semantic foregrounding was removed in the manipulated version ``without imagery''; and semantic, phonetic and grammatical foregrounding were removed in the manipulated version ``without foregrounding.'' Results showed that readers who had read the ``original'' version scored higher on empathy after reading than those who had read the version ``without foregrounding.'' A quantitative analysis of qualitative data showed that participants reading the original version experienced significantly more ambivalent emotions than those in the version without foregrounding. Reflection did not seem to be influenced by foregrounding. Results suggest that personal factors may be more important in evoking reflection.

In Experiment 1, poetic fragments with authentic prospective (syntactically incomplete) or retrospective (syntactically complete) enjambments were investigated; in Experiment 2, enjambments were created --- for the purpose of the experiment --- from poetry that did not originally contain enjambments. We hypothesized that the layout of the text in poetic fragments would affect the degree to which integrative processes take place: in case of prospective enjambments, the syntactic incompleteness may preclude integration at the end of the line (before going to the next line), whereas retrospective enjambments may cause considerable re-interpretation at the next line. We indeed found significant differences in reading patterns between prose and poetry, poetry with and without enjambment, and poetry with prospective and retrospective enjambment. We interpret these results as favoring a dynamic model of language processing, where the amount and type of integration is determined by syntactic (in)completeness, semantic (in)completeness, but also the physical layout of the text.}

Word embeddings represent semantic relations between words as relationships between vectors in a high-dimensional space, specifying a relational model of meaning consistent with contemporary theories of culture. Dimensions induced by word differences ( rich -- poor) in these spaces correspond to dimensions of cultural meaning, and the projection of words onto these dimensions reflects widely shared associations, which we validate with surveys. Analyzing text from millions of books published over 100 years, we show that the markers of class continuously shifted amidst the economic transformations of the twentieth century, yet the basic cultural dimensions of class remained remarkably stable. The notable exception is education, which became tightly linked to affluence independent of its association with cultivated taste.},

  abstract = {Why are the Digital Humanities a genuine part of the Humanities? Attempts are currently being made by arguing that computational methods are at the same time hermeneutic procedures (`screwmeneutics', `hermenumericals'): computation and hermeneutics were mixed. In criticizing this fusion of `literacy' and `numeracy', it is argued that what really connects the classical Humanities and the Digital Humanities is methodologically based on the `cultural technique of flattening' and not on hermeneutics. The projection of spatial and non-spatial relations onto the artificial flatness of inscribed and illustrated surfaces forms a first-order epistemic and cultural potential in the history of the Humanities: diagrammatic reasoning, the visualizing potential of writings, lists, tables, diagrams, and maps, the sorting function of alphabetically ordered knowledge corpora have always shaped and determined basic scholarly work. It is this `diagrammatical' dimension to which the Digital Humanities are linked to Humanities in general. The metamorphosis of texts, pictures, and music into the surface configurations of machine-analyzable data corpora opens up the possibility of revealing latent and implicit patterns of cultural artifacts, and practices that mostly are not accessible to human perception. The quantifying, computational methods of the Digital Humanities operate like computer-generated microscopes and telescopes into the cultural heritage, ongoing cultural practices, and even the culturally unconscious.},

It brings together a varied set of empirical investigations into decline and loss, spanning morphology, syntax and the lexicon, in different languages. Their authors apply diverse methodologies and represent different theoretical approaches. On the basis of this broad span of studies, authors and editors propose generalisations related to decline and loss and assess similarities and differences with processes and motivations of emergence and spread.

  abstract = {Sentiment analysis from data streams is aimed at detecting authors' attitude, emotions and opinions from texts in real-time. To reduce the labeling effort needed in the data collection phase, active learning is often applied in streaming scenarios, where a learning algorithm is allowed to select new examples to be manually labeled in order to improve the learner's performance. Even though there are many on-line platforms which perform sentiment analysis, there is no publicly available interactive on-line platform for dynamic adaptive sentiment analysis, which would be able to handle changes in data streams and adapt its behavior over time. This paper describes ClowdFlows, a cloud-based scientific workflow platform, and its extensions enabling the analysis of data streams and active learning. Moreover, by utilizing the data and workflow sharing in ClowdFlows, the labeling of examples can be distributed through crowdsourcing. The advanced features of ClowdFlows are demonstrated on a sentiment analysis use case, using active learning with a linear Support Vector Machine for learning sentiment classification models to be applied to microblogging data streams.},

Such an instrument should be able to predict different evaluative responses while at the same time being sensi-tive to various stimulus materials, because it could help further the research into the relationships between narrative texts, absorbing experiences and entertain-ment outcomes. This paper develops such an instrument through a literature review, interview study, pilot study, and exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Attention, transportation, emotional engagement and mental imagery were found to be dimensions of story world absorption. The final scale is reliable, sensitive to different stimulus materials and able to predict two different evaluative responses: enjoyment and impact. It is argued that the text a reader reads deter-mines the particular evaluative response to a story world absorption experience.},

Digital Age has established itself with a rich source of information through different Applications of social media upto Chat GPT and other Artificial Intelligence tools in the recent times. It reduces strain in teaching and learning and gives emphasis to knowledge-based strategies. Radio, newspapers and television were the main sources of information before the arrival of the internet. Technology has revolutionized information access across all sectors, largely replacing humans in global learning, making it quick and cost-effective. The move from physical to mental labour has also become widespread, as the transformation of man from traditional practices to technological advancements. Today the success of English as a Global Language and the learning of it relies on surplus information and human resources, with data storage at its peak. Microphotography, microform, wireless networking,internet, information sharing, mobile phones, pocket laptops, and digital cameras evolved.Digital Humanities has opened avenues for intellectual activity using Digital Technology to give a new dimension to the various disciplines in Humanities. Digital resources in Humanities give a face-lift in teaching and learning. When there is no urban/rural divide among the teaching community across the globe, all the teachers of English are expected to have a better knowledge in the use of the latest tools to teach English as a language to any kind of learners effectively with the same humanistic approach practised in conventional teaching. Knowledge of Digital humanities is essential to improve the quality of teaching and learning.This paper aims at contextualising English as a global language by teaching its literature through Digital format by converting the print form of literature into eBooks, Digital Archives, Electronic Literature, and Language Games along with Digital Humanism,which is yet another face of Digital Humanities.

Yet less evidence or consensus exists regarding whether the same link exists between linguistic complexity measures of a sentence or passage and eye movements registered at the sentence or passage level. This article focuses on ``global'' measures of syntactic and lexical complexity, i.e., the measures that characterise the structure of the sentence or passage rather than aggregate lexical properties of individual words. We selected several commonly used global complexity measures and tested their predictive power against sentence- and passage-level eye movements in samples of text reading from 13 languages represented in the Multilingual Eye Movement Corpus (MECO). While some syntactic or lexical complexity measures elicited statistically significant effects, they were negligibly small and not of practical relevance for predicting the processing effort either in individual languages or across languages. These findings suggest that the ``eye-mind'' link known to be valid at the word level may not scale up to larger linguistic units.},

Several quantitative studies have shown a positive correlation between literary reading and empathy. However, the literary nature of the stimuli used in these studies has not been defined at a more detailed, stylistic level. In order to explore the stylistic underpinnings of the hypothesized link between literariness and empathy, we conducted a qualitative experiment in which the degree of stylistic foregrounding was manipulated. Subjects (N = 37) read versions of Katherine Mansfield?s ?The Fly,? a short story rich in foregrounding, while marking striking and evocative passages of their choosing. Afterwards, they were asked to select three markings and elaborate on their experiences in writing. One group read the original story, while the other read a ?non-literary? version, produced by an established author of suspense fiction for young adults, where stylistic foregrounding was reduced. We found that the non-literary version elicited significantly more (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.01) explicitly empathic responses than the original story. This finding stands in contradiction to widely accepted assumptions in recent research, but can be assimilated in alternative models of literariness and affect in literary reading. We present an analysis of the data with a view to offering more than one interpretation of the observed effects of stylistic foregrounding.}

Across centuries and media, adaptations have been used extensively to bring temporally or geographically distant narratives ``closer'' to the recipient under the assumption that their impact will increase. In this article, we review experimental and other empirical evidence on narrative processing in order to unravel which types of personal relevance are more likely to be impactful than others, which types of impact (e.g., aesthetic, therapeutic, persuasive) they have been found to generate, and where their power becomes excessive or outright detrimental to reader experience. Together, the evidence suggests that narratives are read through the lens of the reader's self-schema independently of genre, although certain groups of readers, especially in certain situations, may experience personal relevance and related effects more strongly than others. The literature further suggests that large-scale similarities between reader and character (e.g., gender) may not per se be enough for relevance effects to arise and that emotional valence has a role to play in the process alongside thematic saliency.}

A number of narrative-related problems can be addressed automatically through the analysis of character networks, such as summarization, classification, or role detection. Character networks are particularly relevant when considering               works of fiction               (e.g., novels, plays, movies, TV series), as their exploitation allows developing information retrieval and recommendation systems. However, works of fiction possess specific properties that make these tasks harder.                          This survey aims at presenting and organizing the scientific literature related to the extraction of character networks from works of fiction, as well as their analysis. We first describe the extraction process in a generic way and explain how its constituting steps are implemented in practice, depending on the medium of the narrative, the goal of the network analysis, and other factors. We then review the descriptive tools used to characterize character networks, with a focus on the way they are interpreted in this context. We illustrate the relevance of character networks by also providing a review of applications derived from their analysis. Finally, we identify the limitations of the existing approaches and the most promising perspectives.},

  abstract = {Nature's non-material contributions to people are difficult to quantify and one aspect in particular, nature's contributions to communication (NCC), has so far been neglected. Recent advances in automated language processing tools enable us to quantify diversity patterns underlying the distribution of plant and animal taxon labels in creative literature, which we term BiL (biodiversity in literature). We assume BiL to provide a proxy for people's openness to nature's non-material contributions enhancing our understanding of NCC. We assembled a comprehensive list of 240,000 English biological taxon labels. We pre-processed and searched a subcorpus of digitised literature on Project Gutenberg for these labels. We quantified changes in biodiversity indices commonly used in ecological studies for 16,000 books, encompassing 4,000 authors, as proxies for BiL between 1705 and 1969. We observed hump-shape patterns for taxon label richness, abundance and Shannon diversity indicating a peak of BiL in the middle of the 19th century. This is also true for the ratio of biological to general lexical richness. The variation in label use between different sections within books, quantified as {$\beta$}-diversity, declined until the 1830s and recovered little, indicating a less specialised use of taxon labels over time. This pattern corroborates our hypothesis that before the onset of industrialisation BiL may have increased, reflecting several concomitant influences such as the general broadening of literary content, improved education and possibly an intensified awareness of the starting loss of biodiversity during the period of romanticism. Given that these positive trends continued and that we do not find support for alternative processes reducing BiL, such as language streamlining, we suggest that this pronounced trend reversal and subsequent decline of BiL over more than 100 years may be the consequence of humans' increasing alienation from nature owing to major societal changes in the wake of industrialisation. We conclude that our computational approach of analysing literary communication using biodiversity indices has a high potential for understanding aspects of non-material contributions of biodiversity to people. Our approach can be applied to other corpora and would benefit from additional metadata on taxa, works and authors.

Against the backdrop of the recent discussion in the philosophy of science about what models are and what they do, this paper presents a semiotic perspective on models in the framework of Charles S. Peirce's theory of signs that sheds light on the practice of modeling in the digital humanities. As a first step, it is argued that models are icons, i.e. signs that represent their specific objects by being regarded as similar to them; and that there are, in all, three basic types of model, namely ``images,'' ``diagrams,'' and ``metaphors.'' A second step explicates relevant implications of this model-theoretic approach, especially as they relate to the digital humanities. In particular, it is shown that models are not identical to the things they represent and that they only represent them partially; that the representation operates on the basis of a mapping relation between select properties of the model and its object; that each model and each instance of modeling has a theoretical framework; and that models are the true basis for genuine creativity and progress in research.]}

  abstract = {The increasing roles of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the construction of cultural heritage and humanities datasets necessitate critical examination of the myriad biases introduced by machines, algorithms, and the humans who build and deploy them. From image classification to optical character recognition, the effects of decisions ostensibly made by machines compound through the digitization pipeline and redouble in each step, mediating our interactions with digitally-rendered artifacts through the search and discovery process. As a result, scholars within the digital humanities community have begun advocating for the proper contextualization of cultural heritage datasets within the socio-technical systems in which they are created and utilized. One such approach to this contextualization is the data archaeology, a form of humanistic excavation of a dataset that Paul Fyfe defines as ``recover[ing] and reconstitut[ing] media objects within their changing ecologies'' [Fyfe 2016]. Within critical data studies, this excavation of a dataset - including its construction and mediation via machine learning - has proven to be a capacious approach. However, the data archaeology has yet to be adopted as standard practice among cultural heritage practitioners who produce such datasets with machine learning.}

As more strategic and selective processing during reading should be reflected in higher quality of summaries, the aim of this study was to use eye movement patterns to analyze how readers who produce good quality summaries process texts. 40 undergraduate students were instructed to read six expository texts in order to respond a causal question introduced in the end of the first paragraph. After reading, participants produced an oral summary of the text. Based on the quality of the summaries, participants were divided into three groups: High, Medium and Low Quality Summaries. The results revealed that readers who produced High Quality Summaries made significantly more and longer fixations and regressions in the question-relevant parts of texts when compared to the other two summary groups. These results suggest that the summary task performance could be a good predictor of the reading strategies utilized during reading.}

The development model used is ADDIE consisting of Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation phases. The instruments used, consist of validated student worksheets based on material experts and media experts, pretest questions, posttest questions, and the practicality of student worksheets. The results showed that the student worksheets developed were feasible regarding validity, practicality, and effectiveness. The validity of the student worksheets is indicated by the average score of two material expert validators and two media expert validators, each of which is in the good and excellent categories. The practicality of the student worksheets is denoted by the average value of student assessments included in the practical category. Then its effectiveness is shown by increasing students' critical thinking skills after being given intervention using the student worksheets.},

They are the site of significant sociocultural and economic transformations across many domains, from health and relationships to entertainment and everyday finance. As relatively closed technical systems, apps pose new methodological challenges for sociocultural digital media research. This article describes a method, grounded in a combination of science and technology studies with cultural studies, through which researchers can perform a critical analysis of a given app. The method involves establishing an app's environment of expected use by identifying and describing its vision, operating model and modes of governance. It then deploys a walkthrough technique to systematically and forensically step through the various stages of app registration and entry, everyday use and discontinuation of use. The walkthrough method establishes a foundational corpus of data upon which can be built a more detailed analysis of an app's intended purpose, embedded cultural meanings and implied ideal users and uses. The walkthrough also serves as a foundation for further user-centred research that can identify how users resist these arrangements and appropriate app technology for their own purposes.},

  abstract = {{\textbackslash}textlessp{\textbackslash}textgreaterThe present study addresses the questions of (a) whether Korean learners of English show sensitivity to subject--verb agreement violations in an eye-tracking paradigm, and (b) how reading goals (reading for comprehension vs. translation) and second language (L2) proficiency modulate depth of morphological agreement processing. Thirty-six Korean speakers of L2 English and 32 native English speakers read 40 stimulus sentences, half of which contained subject--verb agreement violations in English. The factors were whether a head and a local intervening noun matched in number and whether a sentence was grammatical or not. In linear mixed models analyses, both agreement violations and noun phrase match/mismatch were found to be disruptive in processing for native speakers at the critical regions (verb and following word), and locally distracting number-marked nouns yielded an asymmetric pattern depending on grammaticality. When L2 speakers were asked to produce offline oral translations of the English sentences into Korean, they became more sensitive to agreement violations. In addition, higher L2 proficiency predicted greater sensitivity to morphological violations. The results indicate that L2 speakers are not necessarily insensitive to morphological violations and that L2 proficiency and task modulate the depth of L2 morphological processing.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater}

  abstract = {Test items become easier when a representational picture visualizes the text item stem; this is referred to as the multimedia effect in testing. To uncover the processes underlying this effect and to understand how pictures affect students' item-solving behavior, we recorded the eye movements of sixty-two schoolchildren solving multiple-choice (MC) science items either with or without a representational picture. Results show that the time students spent fixating the picture was compensated for by less time spent reading the corresponding text. In text-picture items, students also spent less time fixating incorrect answer options; a behavior that was associated with better test scores in general. Detailed gaze likelihood analyses revealed that the picture received particular attention right after item onset and in the later phase of item solving. Hence, comparable to learning, pictures in tests seemingly boost students' performance because they may serve as mental scaffolds, supporting comprehension and decision making.},

  abstract = {This question of disciplinary meaning---which I ask from the viewpoint of the humanities generally---is larger than the question of disciplinary identity now preoccupying ``DH'' itself, as insiders call it. Having reached a critical mass of participants, publications, conferences, grant competitions, institutionalization (centers, programs, and advertised jobs), and general visibility, the field is vigorously forming an identity. Recent debates about whether the digital humanities are a ``big tent'' (Jockers and Worthey), ``who's in and who's out?'' (Ramsay), whether ``you have to know how to code [or be a builder]'' (Ramsay, ``On Building''), the need for ``more hack, less yack'' (Cecire, ``When Digital Humanities''; Koh), and ``who you calling untheoretical?'' (Bauer) witness a dialectics of inclusion and exclusion not unlike that of past emergent fields. An ethnographer of the field, indeed, might take a page from Claude L{\'e}vi-Strauss and chart the current digital humanities as something like a grid of affiliations and differences between neighboring tribes. Exaggerating the differences somewhat, as when a tribe boasts its uniqueness, we can thus say that the digital humanities---much of which affiliates with older humanities disciplines such as literature, history, classics, and the languages; with the remediation of older media such as books and libraries; and ultimately with the value of the old itself (history, archives, the curatorial mission)---are not the tribe of ``new media studies,'' under the sway of the design, visual, and media arts; Continental theory; cultural criticism; and the avant-garde new. Similarly, despite significant trends toward networked and multimodal work spanning social, visual, aural, and haptic media, much of the digital humanities focuses on documents and texts in a way that distinguishes the field's work from digital research in media studies, communication studies, information studies, and sociology. And the digital humanities are exploring new repertoires of interpretive or expressive ``algorithmic criticism'' (the ``second wave'' of the digital humanities proclaimed in ``The Digital Humanities Manifesto 2.0'' [3]) in a way that makes the field not even its earlier self, ``humanities computing,'' alleged to have had narrower technical and service-oriented aims. Recently, the digital humanities' limited engagement with identity and social-justice issues has also been seen to be a differentiating trait---for example, by the vibrant \#transformDH collective, which worries that the digital humanities (unlike some areas of new media studies) are dominantly not concerned with race, gender, alternative sexualities, or disability.},

In the process of information extraction, accurately identification of entities in unstructured geotext is a foundational task that is known as geological named entity recognition (Geo-NER). However, the existing methods generally require a large number of annotated corpora, and face problems with long entity recognition. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-stage fine-tuning method. In the first fine-tuning stage, we use a bidirectional encoder representations from transformers language model with geological domain knowledge (GeoBERT), which combines geological domain knowledge, on a pretrained BERT model, and in the second stage, we use a small number of samples to complete the NER task in the geological report based on GeoBERT. Our proposed model achieves a very high F1-score compared to baseline models on the constructed dataset.}

This feature allows LMMs to address some of the problems identified by Speelman and McGann (2013) about the use of mean data, because they do not average across individual responses. However, recent guidelines for using LMM to analyse skewed reaction time (RT) data collected in many cognitive psychological studies recommend the application of non-linear transformations to satisfy assumptions of normality. Uncritical adoption of this recommendation has important theoretical implications which can yield misleading conclusions. For example, Balota et al. (2013) showed that analyses of raw RT produced additive effects of word frequency and stimulus quality on word identification, which conflicted with the interactive effects observed in analyses of transformed RT. Generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMM) provide a solution to this problem by satisfying normality assumptions without the need for transformation. This allows differences between individuals to be properly assessed, using the metric most appropriate to the researcher's theoretical context. We outline the major theoretical decisions involved in specifying a GLMM, and illustrate them by reanalysing Balota et al.'s datasets. We then consider the broader benefits of using GLMM to investigate individual differences.}

This article discusses a set of experiments explicitly designed to evaluate the impact of parametric syntax in representing historical relatedness, and performed on a selection of 26 contemporary Indo-European varieties. The results show that PCM is in fact able to correctly identify genealogical relations even from modern languages only, performing as accurately as lexical methods, and that its effectiveness is not limited by interference effects such as `horizontal' transmission. PCM is thus validated as a powerful tool for the analysis of historical relationships not only on a long-range perspective (as suggested by Longobardi \& Guardiano 2009), but even on more focused, though independently well-known domains.},

To test several idiolect and sociolect hypotheses a factorial combination was used of time period (Modernism, Realism), gender of author (male, female) and author (Eliot, Dickens, Woolf, Joyce) totaling 16 corresponding literary texts. In a series of corpus linguistic studies using Boolean and vector models, no conclusive evidence was found for the selected idiolect and sociolect hypotheses.

In this paper we revisit those findings. In 11 recognition probe, priming, and self-report experiments, we manipulated Greene et al.'s stories to discover under what circumstances a pronoun's referent is automatically understood. We lengthened the stories from 4 to 8 lines. This simple manipulation led to automatic and correct resolution, which we attribute to readers' increased engagement with the stories. We found evidence of resolution even when the additional text did not mention the pronoun's referent. In addition, our results suggest that the pronoun temporarily boosts the referent's accessibility, an advantage that disappears by the end of the next sentence. Finally, we present evidence from memory experiments that supports complete pronoun resolution for the longer but not the shorter stories.},

We extend this type of study by employing BERT to characterize variation in the senses of words as well, analyzing two months of English comments in 474 Reddit communities. The specificity of different sense clusters to a community, combined with the specificity of a community's unique word types, is used to identify cases where a social group's language deviates from the norm. We validate our metrics using user-created glossaries and draw on sociolinguistic theories to connect language variation with trends in community behavior. We find that communities with highly distinctive language are medium-sized, and their loyal and highly engaged users interact in dense networks.}

  abstract = {Although poetry reception is often considered to be a highly emotional process, psychological research on emotional experiences when reading poetry is anything but abundant. Most research on poetry reception addresses the influence of poetic devices like meter and rhyme on readers' comprehension, appreciation, and the recollection of the poem. Empathic reactions and emotional involvement as described, for example, in studies on reading narratives are rarely discussed. Here, we propose that poetry is predisposed to induce a variety of different kinds of affective responses and feelings. In particular, we put forward the mood empathy hypothesis, according to which poems expressing moods of persons, situations, or objects should engage readers to mentally simulate and affectively resonate with the depicted state of affairs. We report evidence that this resonance can lead to the experience of the depicted mood itself, or some feeling closely associated with it, a process similar to empathy as a kind of Einfuhlung or feeling in. Our results are interpreted in the larger frame of the neurocognitive poetics model of literary reading (Jacobs, 2011, 2014). In line with the model's postulate that backgrounding elements facilitate emotional involvement while foregrounding features promote aesthetic evaluation, we identified different predictors for both processes: familiarity and situational embedding were the main factors mediating mood empathy, and aesthetic liking was best predicted from foregrounding features like style and form. By supporting the mood empathy hypothesis, these findings open new perspectives for future studies on literary reading and poetics.},

(Schreibman et al., A companion to digital humanities (pp. xxiii?xxvii). Blackwell; 2004) and its position in the overall academic landscape are still being negotiated. While there are countless essays and opinion pieces that debate the status of DH, little research has been dedicated to exploring the field in a systematic and empirical way (Poole, Journal of Documentation; 2017:73). This study aims to contribute to the existing research gap by comparing articles published over the past three decades in three established English-language DH journals (Computers and the Humanities, Literary and Linguistic Computing, Digital Humanities Quarterly) with research articles from journals in 15 other academic disciplines (corpus size: 34,041 articles; 299 million tokens). As a method of analysis, we use latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling, combined with recent approaches that aggregate topic models by means of hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Our findings indicate that DH is simultaneously a discipline in its own right and a highly interdisciplinary field, with many connecting factors to neighboring disciplines?first and foremost, computational linguistics, and information science. Detailed descriptive analyses shed some light on the diachronic development of DH and also highlight topics that are characteristic for DH.},

To investigate the extent to which prediction might facilitate reading, a large-scale survey provided cloze scores for all 2689 words in 55 different text passages. Highly predictable words were quite rare (5\% of content words), and most words had a more-expected competitor. An eye-tracking study showed sensitivity to cloze probability but no mis-prediction cost. Instead, the presence of a more-expected competitor was found to be facilitative in several measures. Further, semantic and morphosyntactic information was highly predictable even when word identity was not, and this information facilitated reading above and beyond the predictability of the full word form. The results are consistent with graded prediction but inconsistent with full lexical prediction. Implications for theories of prediction in language comprehension are discussed.}

However, in the lme4 package in R the standards for evaluating significance of fixed effects in these models (i.e., obtaining p-values) are somewhat vague. There are good reasons for this, but as researchers who are using these models are required in many cases to report p-values, some method for evaluating the significance of the model output is needed. This paper reports the results of simulations showing that the two most common methods for evaluating significance, using likelihood ratio tests and applying the z distribution to the Wald t values from the model output (t-as-z), are somewhat anti-conservative, especially for smaller sample sizes. Other methods for evaluating significance, including parametric bootstrapping and the Kenward-Roger and Satterthwaite approximations for degrees of freedom, were also evaluated. The results of these simulations suggest that Type 1 error rates are closest to .05 when models are fitted using REML and p-values are derived using the Kenward-Roger or Satterthwaite approximations, as these approximations both produced acceptable Type 1 error rates even for smaller samples.}

Although these approaches all used the concept of `audiences', they are widely varied and mainly had one thing in common: being attracted to the analysis of the rapidly emerging media technology of the second half of the 20th century: television. Television was a phenomenon that was both powerful---technologically, socially, and culturally---and diffused so rapidly that it attracted, perhaps demanded, the attention of theorists from across the social sciences, arts, and humanities, all of which were interested in how people responded to, what they did with, and how they were affected by media. However, the commonality across these approaches could have been more transparent, and the discontinuities were not so much at the level of observation and analysis but inherent in the assumptions from the different disciplinary and normative approaches.},

  abstract = {Abstract Visualization in digital humanities (DH) has developed into a charged topic as increasing numbers of humanities researchers begin to work with machine-readable data. The current research literature on DH visualization has primarily approached the subject from a theoretical perspective, arguing the humanistic visualization should fundamentally differ from scientific visualization to represent the distinct nature of humanities data and inquiries. However, few studies have tried to empirically understand what it means to be a good visualization for humanities researchers and practitioners. This study aims to bridge this research gap by offering an exploratory investigation into researchers' perceptions on visualization, particularly how they evaluate a visualization in humanities research. Through 10 semi-structured interviews with humanities scholars engaging in digital work, our study demonstrates that perceptions of a quality visualization among the humanities researchers are closely related to researchers' purposes of using visualization and their self-confidence in visualization knowledge and skills. This study serves as a baseline for future empirical research on DH visualization and potentially informs the best practices for humanistic visualizations.},

Inscription serves as a fundamental rhetorical device in research outputs and practices. As many inscriptions are deeply rooted in a scientific research paradigm, they can be used to evaluate the level of scientificity of a scientific field. This is specifically helpful to understand the relationships between research traditions in digital humanities (DH), a highly cross-disciplinary between various humanities and scientific traditions. This paper presents a quantitative, community-focused examination of how inscriptions are used in English-language research articles in DH journals. We randomly selected 252 articles published between 2011 and 2020 from a representative DH journal list, and manually classified the inscriptions and author domains in these publications. We found that inscriptions have been increasingly used during the past decade, and their uses are more intensive in publications led by STEM authors comparing to other domains. This study offers a timely survey of the disciplinary landscape of DH from the perspective of inscriptions and sheds light on how different research approaches collaborate and combat in the field of DH.}

The quantitative analyses of word category distributions of two dominantly enactive and two dominantly descriptive texts indicated significant differences especially in the number of verbs, with more verbs in enactment compared to descriptive texts. In a second study, participants read two texts (one theoretically cueing descriptive imagery, the other cueing enactment imagery) while their eye movements were recorded. After reading, participants completed questionnaires assessing aspects of the reading experience generally, as well as their text-elicited mental imagery specifically. Results show that readers experienced more difficulties conjuring up mental images during reading descriptive style texts and that longer fixation duration on words were associated with enactive style text. We propose that enactive style involves more imagery processes which can be reflected in eye movement behavior.},

We argue that such search options open up novel ways of using concordances to link lexico-grammatical and textual patterns. We focus specifically on patterns for the creation of fictional characters. From a technical point of view, we explain the XML annotation that CLiC works with. Our discussion of textual examples focusses on phrases in fictional speech that illustrate significant differences between text within and outside quotation marks. In terms of theory, we argue that CLiC supports the identification of textual patterns that can provide insights into fictional minds and contribute to the exploration of readerly effects within the wider framework of mind-modelling.}

We focus on the `quotes' subsets of the corpora, i.e. text within quotation marks, which is mostly equivalent to direct speech. These quotes subsets are compared across the fiction corpora and with the spoken component of the British National Corpus 1994. The comparisons illustrate how fictional speech-bundles can be described on a continuum from lexical bundles in real spoken language to repeated sequences of words that are specific to individual fictional characters. Typical functions of fictional speech-bundles are the description of interactions and interpersonal relationships of fictional characters. While our approach crucially depends on an innovative corpus linguistic methodology, it also draws on theoretical insights into spoken grammar and characterisation in fiction in order to question traditional notions of realism and authenticity in fictional speech.},

First, all the lines in Khaghani's divan are classified and coded into three categories (mystical, non-mystical, and borderline). Then a set of chi-square goodness-of-fit tests are used to investigate and compare the frequency of different line's categories for all lines and all odes, separately. Finally, the chi-square independence test (crosstabs) is employed to investigate the existence of trend in the lines.}

  abstract = {Studies in several languages have shown that subject-relative clauses are easier to process than object-relative clauses. Mak, Vonk, and Schriefers (2006) have proposed the topichood hypothesis to account for the preference for subject-relative clauses. This hypothesis claims that the entity in the relative clause that is most topicworthy will be chosen as the subject. By default, the antecedent of the relative clause will be chosen as the subject of the relative clause, because it is the topic of the relative clause. However, when the noun phrase (NP) in the relative clause is also topicworthy, the preference for the antecedent to be the subject will disappear. This was confirmed in two experiments. In Experiment 1, we tested relative clauses with a personal pronoun in the relative clause. We obtained a preference for object-relative clauses, in line with the assumption that personal pronouns refer to a discourse topic and are thus topicworthy. In Experiment 2, the discourse status of the NP in the relative clause was manipulated; either it was not present in the preceding context, or it was the discourse topic. The experiment showed that when the NP in the relative clause refers to the discourse topic, the difficulty of object-relative clauses is reduced, in comparison with relative clauses with an NP that is new in the discourse, even in the absence of any explicit cue in the relative clause itself. The experiments show that discourse factors guide processing at the sentence level.}

In this study, we tried to pinpoint how different kinds of simulation (perceptual and motor simulation, mentalising) affect reading behaviour. Eye-tracking (gaze durations, regression probability) and questionnaire data were collected from 102 participants, who read three literary short stories. In a pre-test, 90 additional participants indicated which parts of the stories were high in one of the three kinds of simulation-eliciting content. The results show that motor simulation reduces gaze duration (faster reading), whereas perceptual simulation and mentalising increase gaze duration (slower reading). Individual differences in the effect of simulation on gaze duration were found, which were related to individual differences in aspects of story world absorption and story appreciation. These findings suggest fundamental differences between different kinds of simulation and confirm the role of simulation in absorption and appreciation.}

  abstract = {This paper explores a novel methodological approach to the study of prescriptive language norm dissemination. It reports the result of a study which uses Corpus-Assisted Discourse Studies (cads) inductively, to identify lexis and discursive patterns indicative of normativity and prescriptivism, in a corpus of literary reviews from Late Modern English. Previous attempts to identify prescriptivism using corpus-based approaches have tended to proceed deductively, using pre-defined indicators of prescriptivism. However, this study uses a speculative research model which proceeds inductively, allowing the datatset to direct the analysis. Thus, whereas research using pre-defined `indicators of prescriptivism' risks overlooking significant patterns of usage, this approach facilitates a synergy of quantitative and qualitative corpus methods which both yields a broad overview of usage patterns and enables in-depth analysis of relevant discourses. Keywords are used to engage quantitatively with a purpose-built corpus, before collocation and concordancing are used iteratively, allowing immersion of the researcher in the dataset. This methodology yields a set of lexical items which identify moments of prescriptivism and/or normativity in the purpose-built corpus. The findings reported demonstrate the promise of using discourse analytic procedures to examine the performance and dissemination of normativity, in a way that could ultimately be replicated in different contexts.},

Grammaticality is ensured by re-interpreting the subject as 1st person plural, thereby changing the underlying discourse composition of the sentence (We protesters announced a strike). The comparison of Unagreement with structurally similar sentences (Experiment 1), truly person-anomalous sentences (Experiments 2 and 3) and discourse-incongruent sentences (Experiment 4) revealed a clear dissociation between morphosyntactic-related and discourse-related analysis in agreement comprehension. The constant first-pass effect elicited by Unagreement with respect to structurally similar (grammatical and ungrammatical) sentences across the four experiments evidences the sensitivity of early stages to morphosyntactic evaluation, while the differential effect for discourse-congruous and discourse-incongruous sentences in later measures suggests that discourse-related analyses are dealt with by the parser in subsequent stages of processing. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

This research will adopt a qualitative approach using the case study method in several higher education institutions. Data will be collected through in-depth interviews, observation, and document analysis related to digital literacy strategies in the learning environment. Next, the data will be analyzed using a content analysis approach to identify which strategies most effectively empower students' critical thinking skills. It is hoped that the results of this study will provide in-depth insight into how digital literacy can be properly integrated into the higher education curriculum to stimulate students' critical thinking skills. The implication of this research is to provide practical guidance to educators, lecturers, and decision-makers in higher education institutions to design learning strategies that support the development of digital literacy and critical thinking. In addition, this research can also contribute to further research in the field of digital literacy and higher education. With a stronger focus on incorporating digital technologies in higher education, it is hoped that this research will provide valuable directions for the development of relevant and innovative curricula, which in turn will help produce graduates who are not only technically proficient but also able to think critically in facing complex modern world challenges.}

We find that the roots of sentiment analysis are in the studies on public opinion analysis at the beginning of 20th century and in the text subjectivity analysis performed by the computational linguistics community in 1990's. However, the outbreak of computer-based sentiment analysis only occurred with the availability of subjective texts on the Web. Consequently, 99\% of the papers have been published after 2004. Sentiment analysis papers are scattered to multiple publication venues, and the combined number of papers in the top-15 venues only represent ca. 30\% of the papers in total. We present the top-20 cited papers from Google Scholar and Scopus and a taxonomy of research topics. In recent years, sentiment analysis has shifted from analyzing online product reviews to social media texts from Twitter and Facebook. Many topics beyond product reviews like stock markets, elections, disasters, medicine, software engineering and cyberbullying extend the utilization of sentiment analysis.},

Typically, this problem has been dealt with the use of Cohen's weighted kappa, which is a modification of the original kappa statistic, proposed for nominal variables in the case of two observers. Fleiss (1971) put forth a generalization of kappa in the case of multiple observers, but both Cohen's and Fleiss' kappa could have a paradoxical behavior, which may lead to a difficult interpretation of their magnitude. In this paper, a modification of Fleiss' kappa, not affected by paradoxes, is proposed, and subsequently generalized to the case of ordinal variables. Monte Carlo simulations are used both to testing statistical hypotheses and to calculating percentile and bootstrap-t confidence intervals based on this statistic. The normal asymptotic distribution of the proposed statistic is demonstrated. Our results are applied to the classical Holmquist et~al.'s (1967) dataset on the classification, by multiple observers, of carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix. Finally, we generalize the use of s* to a bivariate case.},

Numerous studies have extensively employed these databases using both behavioral and neuroimaging methods. However, some limitations of the existing databases have recently been reported, including limited numbers of stimuli in specific categories or poor picture quality of the visual stimuli. In the present article, we introduce the Nencki Affective Picture System (NAPS), which consists of 1,356 realistic, high-quality photographs that are divided into five categories (people, faces, animals, objects, and landscapes). Affective ratings were collected from 204 mostly European participants. The pictures were rated according to the valence, arousal, and approach--avoidance dimensions using computerized bipolar semantic slider scales. Normative ratings for the categories are presented for each dimension. Validation of the ratings was obtained by comparing them to ratings generated using the Self-Assessment Manikin and the International Affective Picture System. In addition, the physical properties of the photographs are reported, including luminance, contrast, and entropy. The new database, with accompanying ratings and image parameters, allows researchers to select a variety of visual stimulus materials specific to their experimental questions of interest. The NAPS system is freely accessible to the scientific community for noncommercial use by request at http://naps.nencki.gov.pl.}

  abstract = {The fact is that every writer creates his own precursors. His work modifies our conception of the past, as it will modify the future.Jorge Luis Borges The question of the legacies of modernist fiction for the generations of writers that followed could lead us in a number of different directions. As perspectives on the literary and cultural history of the past century shift and alter, maps will be differently drawn. In particular, the literary-historical narrative in which 'high modernism' gave way (after the extreme experiment of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake (1939) and with the coming of the Second World War) to postwar realism, and cosmopolitanism to parochialism, requires, and is receiving, substantial revision. The 'realisms' of many mid-twentieth century writers and beyond are beginning to look not only more interesting and more complex, but closer to the 'modernisms' that they are conventionally held to have displaced. There is much new work to be undertaken on this and related questions. The focus of this chapter is a little different, in that it explores the legacies of modernism as a question of direct, rather than diffuse, influences. It discusses writers of the mid-twentieth century (including B. S. Johnson, Saul Bellow and Doris Lessing) and their relationship to their modernist predecessors, but its primary focus is on the ways in which recent and contemporary novelists (including Paul Auster, Alan Hollinghurst, Don DeLillo, Ian McEwan, Salman Rushdie, Jeanette Winterson, Zadie Smith, Michael Cunningham and Colm T{\'o}ib{\'i}n) are engaging with modernist fiction and its creators.},

Like 10 PRINT CHR\$ (205.5 + RND (1)); : GOTO 10, Mark Marino's Critical Code Studies treats code not as merely functional but as a text, one that can be read, and misinterpreted, by non-programmers. As the author notes, code's "meaning is not determined entirely by the programmer's intention but also by how it is received and recirculated. That is not to argue that code can be taken out of context or that code means whatever people say it means but rather that the meaning of code is contingent and that code is subject to the rhetorical triad of speaker, audience (both human and machine), and message." It is time to develop methods of tracing the meaning of code. Computer source code has become part of our political, legal, aesthetic, and popular discourse. Code is being read by lawyers, corporate managers, artists, pundits, reporters, and even literary scholars. Code is being used in political debate, in artistic exhibitions, in popular entertainment, and in historical accounts. As code reaches more and more readers and as programming languages and methods continue to evolve, we need to develop methods to account for the way code accrues meaning and how the readers and shifting contexts shape that meaning. We need to learn not only to understand the functioning of code but the way code signifies. We need to learn to read code critically. Critical Code Studies offers a CCS "starting kit," a set of techniques that scholars and other interested parties can use to interpret code in a non-computational context"--},

In this paper, we focus on detecting the target of hate speech in Dutch social media: whether a hateful Facebook comment is directed against migrants or not (i.e., against someone else). We manually annotate the relevant conversational context and investigate the effect of different aspects of context on performance when adding it to a Dutch transformer-based pre-trained language model, BERTje. We show that performance of the model can be significantly improved by integrating relevant contextual information.}

The "Beyond the Book" project investigates whether web resources like Wikipedia can be used to establish the level of cultural bias. This work describes the eScience tools used to estimate the cultural appeal of a book: semantic linking is used to identify key words in the text of the book, and afterwards the revision information from corresponding Wikipedia articles is examined to identify countries that generated a more than average amount of contributions to those articles. Comparison between the number of contributions from two countries on the same set of articles may show with which knowledge the contributors are familiar. We assume a lack of contributions from a country may indicate a gap in the knowledge of readers from that country. We assume that a book dealing with that concept could be more exotic and therefore more appealing for certain readers, while others are therefore less interested in the book. An indication of the 'level of exoticness' thus could help a reader/publisher to decide to read/translate the book or not. Experimental results are presented for four selected books from a set of 564 books written in Dutch or translated into Dutch, assessing their potential appeal for a Canadian audience. A qualitative assessment of quantitative results provides insight into named entities that may indicate a high/low cultural bias towards a book.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               To ascertain if undergraduate medical students attain adequate knowledge to practice in paediatrics, we designed the minimum accepted competency (MAC) examination. This was a set of MCQ's designed to test the most basic, `must know' knowledge as determined by non-faculty paediatric clinicians. Only two-thirds of undergraduate students passed this exam, despite 96\% of the same cohort passing their official university paediatric examination.               We aim to describe the psychometric properties of the MAC examination to explore why there was a difference in student performance between these two assessments which should, in theory, be testing the same subject area. We will also investigate if the MAC examination is a potentially reliable method of assessing undergraduate knowledge.                                         Methods               The MAC examination was sat by three groups of undergraduate medical students and paediatric trainee doctors. Test item analysis was performed using facility index, discrimination index and Cronbach's alpha.                                         Results               Test item difficulty on the MAC between each group was positively correlated. Correlation of item difficulty with the standard set for each item showed a statistically significant positive relationship. However, for 10 of the items, the mean score achieved by the candidates did not even reach two standard deviations below the standard set by the faculty. Medical students outperformed the trainee doctors on three items. 18 of 30 items achieved a discrimination index\,{$>$}\,0.2. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.22--0.59.                                         Conclusion               Despite faculty correctly judging that this would be a difficult paper for the candidates, there were a significant number of items on which students performed particularly badly. It is possible that the clinical emphasis in these non-faculty derived questions was juxtaposed with the factual recall often required for university examinations.               The MAC examination highlights the difference in the level of knowledge expected of a junior doctor starting work in paediatrics between faculty and non-faculty clinicians and can identify gaps between the current curriculum and the `hidden curriculum' required for real world clinical practice. The faculty comprises physicians in employment by the University whose role it is to design the paediatric curriculum and deliver teaching to undergraduate students. Non-faculty clinicians are paediatric physicians who work soley as clinicians with no affiliation to an educational institution.               The concept of a MAC examination to test basic medical knowledge is feasible and the study presented is an encouraging first step towards this method of assessment.},

In order to demonstrate how this might work I draw upon my own experiences of lecturing on a first year undergraduate course in stylistics (LING 131 Language and Style). I discuss the reasoning behind the teaching methods used on the course as a means of showing how foregrounding elements of a lecture might result in a more effective learning experience for students. I also explain how the effectiveness of LING 131 is due to its unique presentation of foregrounding via foregrounding.}

  abstract = {Literary mapping has developed in fascinating ways in recent years, both as a field of study and as a practical tool to pursue those studies. However, one area of literary mapping as a subject remains under explored ? the use and production of literary mappings by lay readers. Recent research into non-scholarly use and production of literary mappings has suggested that they are expressive, creative and affective practices. In the hands of lay readers, literary mappings have affective agency, they can tell stories, they can be catalysts of personal and worldly change. In this article I will show how we might see and feel these expressive, creative properties of literary mapping in action; to offer these affective properties as an answer to the question ?what can literary mappings do??. I explore this question here through a reading of a literary mapping of Dartmoor produced by Sherlockian fan Philip Weller, made within the context of the Sherlockian ?Game? to align actual and fictional times and places. By framing my reading through the lens of enchantment, I will focus on the role of Weller?s mapping as both a catalyst for, and a representation of, Thurgill and Lovell?s (2016) theory of the ?spatial hinge?, that affective, creative moment when fictional and actual worlds bleed into each other. I suggest we can see Weller?s experience of the ?spatial hinge? and feel his mappings role in inciting his affective encounters with landscape and story, in action.}

Among other measures, we examined regressive eye movements made while readers were recovering in reading mild garden path sentences. The sentences had an adverbial clause that, depending on the mood (indicative vs. subjunctive) of the subordinate clause verb, could attachhigh (to the main verb of the sentence) orlow (to the verb in the subordinate clause). Although Spanish speakers favor low attachment, the high attachment version was quite easy to understand. Readers predominately used two alternative strategies to recover from the mild garden path in our sentences. In the more common reanalysis strategy, their eyes regressed from the last region (disambiguation+1) directly to the main verb in the sentence. Following this, they reread the rest of the sentence, fixating the next region and the adverb (the beginning of the ambiguous part of the sentence). Less frequently, readers regressed from the last region (disambiguation+1) directly to the adverb. We argue that both types of strategies are consistent with a selective reanalysis process as described by Frazier and Rayner (1982).}

Sentiment Analysis in Social Networks begins with an overview of the latest research trends in the field. It then discusses the sociological and psychological processes underling social network interactions. The book explores both semantic and machine learning models and methods that address context-dependent and dynamic text in online social networks, showing how social network streams pose numerous challenges due to their large-scale, short, noisy, context- dependent and dynamic nature. Further, this volume: Takes an interdisciplinary approach from a number of computing domains, including natural language processing, machine learning, big data, and statistical methodologiesProvides insights into opinion spamming, reasoning, and social network analysisShows how to apply sentiment analysis tools for a particular application and domain, and how to get the best results for understanding the consequencesServes as a one-stop reference for the state-of-the-art in social media analytics.},

The rapid growth in adoption of LMMs has been matched by a proliferation of differences in practice. Unless this diversity is recognized, and checked, the field shall reap enormous difficulties in the future when attempts are made to consolidate or synthesize research findings. Here we examine this diversity using two methods -- a survey of researchers (n~=~163) and a quasi-systematic review of papers using LMMs (n~=~400). The survey reveals substantive concerns among psychologists using or planning to use LMMs and an absence of agreed standards. The review of papers complements the survey, showing variation in how the models are built, how effects are evaluated and, most worryingly, how models are reported. Using these data as our departure point, we present a set of best practice guidance, focusing on the reporting of LMMs. It is the authors' intention that the paper supports a step-change in the reporting of LMMs across the psychological sciences, preventing a trajectory in which findings reported today cannot be transparently understood and used tomorrow.},

In this editorial, we discuss this technology from the academic's perspective with regard to its limitations and utility for academic writing, education, and programming. We end with our stance with regard to using LLMs and chatbots in academia, which is summarized as (1) we must find ways to effectively use them, (2) their use does not constitute plagiarism (although they may produce plagiarized text), (3) we must quantify their bias, (4) users must be cautious of their poor accuracy, and (5) the future is bright for their application to research and as an academic tool.},

Tasked with a mandate to render academic development support to academic staff, postgraduate, and undergraduate students to achieve equity (not equality) of outcomes, NWU's Faculty Teaching and Learning Support (FTLS) directorate continues to rethink its strategy and approach in fulfilling its mandate long after the merging of the three historically different institutions on 1 January 2004. The directorate understands that there are common, fundamental, and core student academic development and support, and academic professional development needs across the three campuses that should be aligned, yet our engagement has shown repeatedly that such support is always situational and, inadvertently, contextual. Drawing on New Literacy Studies as theoretical lens to advance its argument, this paper used the literature review method to present the rationale for a restructured FTLS work strategy at NWU to respond better to demands for supporting the academic project in the context of decolonising higher education.}

These possibilities were tested in four studies in which segment by segment reading times and ratings were collected from readers of a short story. In each study, foregrounded segments of the story were associated with increased reading times, greater strikingness ratings, and greater affect ratings. Response to foregrounding appeared to be independent of literary competence or experience.

Also, a series of five studies provided preliminary evidence that each scale may be located in a theoretically plausible network of relations with certain global personality traits (e.g., Absorption), with aspects of cognitive style (e.g., Regression in the Service of the Ego), and with some of the learning skills that are relevant to effective work in the classroom (e.g., Elaborative Processing).

Then I suggest the importance of defining theories that draw from the literary domain, not outside it (such as psychology or linguistics), and that these should lead us to a set of hypotheses that can be subjected to empirical testing with readers. We should also have in the mind the possibility of learning what purposes literature fulfils for the individual or the wider community.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater}

Arguing for the body as an active participant in shaping the aesthetic experience, it begins with examples of the active body taken from Donne, Woolf, and Wordsworth. Empirical study of readers' systematic responses to foregrounding (striking stylistic elements) is then shown to demonstrate the central role of feeling (Miall DS, Kuiken D, Poetics 22:389--407, 1994), while a follow-up study (Kuijpers MM, Miall DS, Bodily involvement in literary reading: an experimental study of readers' bodily experiences during reading. In: Hakemulder F (ed) De stralende lezer: Wetenschappelijk onderzoek naar de invloed van het lezen. Stichting Lezen Reeks (Dutch Reading Foundation), Delft, pp 160--182, 2011) verifies the bodily effects of foregrounding. A review of ERP (evoked response potential) studies of emotion and language lends support to the claim that the early response to foregrounding, occurring less than 500 milliseconds after the encounter with a word, is likely to be characterized by feeling. The last section of the chapter reports on the ambiguities of the unreliable first person narrator of Graham Greene's short story ``The Innocent.'' The responses of one reader to the story are analysed, showing the conflicts of feeling that shape her understanding and that have grown out of the reader's embodied mind and feelings. For her the power of the story appears to lie in the issues it leaves unresolved.},

We survey the vast terrain of `culturomics,' focusing on linguistic and cultural phenomena that were reflected in the English language between 1800 and 2000. We show how this approach can provide insights about fields as diverse as lexicography, the evolution of grammar, collective memory, the adoption of technology, the pursuit of fame, censorship, and historical epidemiology. Culturomics extends the boundaries of rigorous quantitative inquiry to a wide array of new phenomena spanning the social sciences and the humanities.},

  abstract = {The possibility of ``dual voice'' in free indirect discourse has attracted considerable attention in the fields of stylistics, cognitive science and literary criticism. An area suitable for empirical research studies in this regard is point of view and how it is identified during the reading process by non-native speakers as well as the role of translators in influencing the reader to accept a particular point of view. This paper presents results of a research study designed to examine how readers respond to free indirect discourse. The research considered four research questions: RQ1: Do readers hear a `dual voice' when reading passages of free indirect discourse? RQ2: What kind of `contexts' influence the identification of point of view? RQ3: Are there any differences in the results obtained between non-native speakers reading the original literary text and native speakers of the language reading the translation of the same original? RQ4: Has the translator influenced the readers of the translation in any way (thus serving as a ``third voice'')? The text for the experiment was from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The experiment was conducted with two groups of participants: 38 non-native university students studying English as one of their majors to become elementary school teachers of English and 40 university students and native speakers of Croatian studying to become elementary school teachers teaching all core subjects. The results show that a quarter of the study participants could hear the ``dual voice'' and that the translator's influence remained for the most part irrelevant. The difference between the two study groups was not substantial and the reasons for choosing their answers mentioned by the participants did not significantly differ.},

  abstract = {When people read temporarily ambiguous sentences, there is often an increased prevalence of regressive eye-movements launched from the word that resolves the ambiguity. Traditionally, such regressions have been interpreted at least in part as reflecting readers' efforts to re-read and reconfigure earlier material, as exemplified by the Selective Reanalysis hypothesis [Frazier, L., \& Rayner, K. (1982). Making and correcting errors during sentence comprehension: Eye movements in the analysis of structurally ambiguous sentences. Cognitive Psychology, 14, 178--210]. Within such frameworks it is assumed that the selection of saccadic landing-sites is linguistically supervised. As an alternative to this proposal, we consider the possibility (dubbed the Time Out hypothesis) that regression control is partly decoupled from linguistic operations and that landing-sites are instead selected on the basis of low-level spatial properties such as their proximity to the point from which the regressive saccade was launched. Two eye-tracking experiments were conducted to compare the explanatory potential of these two accounts. Experiment 1 manipulated the formatting of linguistically identical sentences and showed, contrary to purely linguistic supervision, that the landing site of the first regression from a critical word was reliably influenced by the physical layout of the text. Experiment 2 used a fixed physical format but manipulated the position in the display at which reanalysis-relevant material was located. Here the results showed a highly reliable linguistic influence on the overall distribution of regression landing sites (though with few effects being apparent on the very first regression). These results are interpreted as reflecting mutually exclusive forms of regression control with fixation sequences being influenced both by spatially constrained, partially decoupled supervision systems as well as by some kind of linguistic guidance. The findings are discussed in relation to existing computational models of eye-movements in reading.},

This study used an interpretive approach to analyze interviews from 20 nursing students at two Canadian Baccalaureate programs to understand how nursing's educational context, including its hidden curriculums, impacted student writing activities. We viewed this qualitative data through the lens of activity theory. Students spoke about navigating a rigid writing context. This resulted in a hyper-focus on ``figuring out'' the teacher with minimal focus on the act of writing. Students used a form of behavioral ``code-switching'' to maximize their grade while considering how their ``valuing'' of the assignment fit within their writing motives. Hidden curriculum messages taught students that academic success was assured whether their writing mirrored instructor preferences. Instructional practices of rigidity reinforced unequal social conditions for some minority students. Faculty can counteract the impact of the hidden curriculum through encouragement of choice and independent thinking about writing activities. Acknowledging power relationships and their influence on how students navigate writing assignments and nursing discourse may relieve pressures on students who fear penalties for countering norms and result in a more flexible learning environment.},

  abstract = {Images have become a key vehicle for communicating climate change, especially in a visually oriented social media ecosystem. However, few studies have examined the ways in which climate change is visually communicated on those platforms. This study addresses that gap by examining more than 2\,million images appearing alongside tweets containing \#climatechange, identifying the types of images different stakeholders share and the amount of engagement those images elicit. It highlights differences in the image types that are published frequently (e.g., textual visualizations), the image types that users prefer to engage with (e.g., protest images), and the impact of bots and a cyclical communication pattern keyed to focusing events. These findings are then evaluated through a conceptual framework of media logics, which helps highlight some of the distinctions between (news) media logic and social media logic---and their emerging hybridization---within the context of climate change communication.},

Why was there a European but not a Chinese rise of the novel in the course of the eighteenth century? Disparate as they may sound, the questions have a common source in the guiding idea of the collection The Novel: ``to make the literary field longer, larger, and deeper''---historically longer, geographically larger, and morphologically deeper than those few classics of nineteenth-century Western European ``realism'' that have dominated the recent theory of the novel (and my own work). What the questions have in common is that they all point to processes that loom large in the history of the novel but not in its theory. Here I reflect on this discrepancy and suggest a few possible alternatives.}

As digital interfaces become an important access point for news, journalism and visualization scholars have begun to share a common research interest: data journalism. Given their radically different traditions and histories, these areas follow very different rules in how the topic is approached. The result is two parallel scholarships on data journalism with little points of contact. Arguably, developing research space for encounters and exchange of the two is an opportunity for expanding the academic discourse on data journalism. This study aims at opening this space of exchange through a systematic literature review. 121 articles, published between 2010 and 2023, are analyzed. Findings show that the two areas of research approach data journalism with very different aspirations. In relation to data journalism, journalism studies and visualization research could be compared with Lazersfeld's distinction between critical and administrative research. These aspects cause various differences at an epistemic level, namely what, how and when knowledge about data journalism is produced.},

Although ChatGPT assures that it is impartial, the literature suggests that LLMs exhibit bias involving race, gender, religion, and political orientation. Political bias in LLMs can have adverse political and electoral consequences similar to bias from traditional and social media. Moreover, political bias can be harder to detect and eradicate than gender or racial bias. We propose a novel empirical design to infer whether ChatGPT has political biases by requesting it to impersonate someone from a given side of the political spectrum and comparing these answers with its default. We also propose dose-response, placebo, and profession-politics alignment robustness tests. To reduce concerns about the randomness of the generated text, we collect answers to the same questions 100 times, with question order randomized on each round. We find robust evidence that ChatGPT presents a significant and systematic political bias toward the Democrats in the US, Lula in Brazil, and the Labour Party in the UK. These results translate into real concerns that ChatGPT, and LLMs in general, can extend or even amplify the existing challenges involving political processes posed by the Internet and social media. Our findings have important implications for policymakers, media, politics, and academia stakeholders.}

Investigators in a wide variety of fields such as psychology, artificial intelligence, linguistics, philosophy, education, and the neurosciences have come to realize the importance of developing an understanding of language comprehension as a tool for understanding the workings of the mind. On the one hand, there are the philosophers, logicians, and mathematicians who are interested in formal semantics or the study of formal systems (e.g., Barwise and Perry, 1983; Montague, 1974; Seuren, 1985). This chapter is not concerned with this emphasis on representation in terms of a formal descriptive system. On the other hand, many researchers are interested in describing natural language as a means of communication, both in terms of its structure and its use as a communicative device. Linguists, for example, are concerned with analyses at the sentential level; however, a substantial amount of work has been done recently on larger portions of discourse in an area of study sometimes referred to as discourse analysis (Brown and Yule, 1983). Computer scientists, for example, are interested in building working computational language systems (Allen, 1987). Psychologists, in particular, are interested in both the representations and the processes involved in language comprehension.},

  abstract = {In the present study, poets and cognitive scientists came together to investigate the construction of meaning in the process of reading normative, 3-line English-language haiku (ELH), as found in leading ELH journals. The particular haiku which we presented to our readers consisted of two semantically separable parts, or images, that were set in a `tense' relationship by the poet. In our sample of poems, the division, or cut , between the two parts was positioned either after line 1 or after line 2; and the images related to each other in terms of either a context--action association ( context--action haiku ) or a conceptually more abstract association ( juxtaposition haiku ). From a constructivist perspective, understanding such haiku would require the reader to integrate these parts into a coherent `meaning Gestalt', mentally (re-)creating the pattern intended by the poet (or one from within the poem's meaning potential). To examine this process, we recorded readers' eye movements, and we obtained measures of memory for the read poems as well as subjective ratings of comprehension difficulty and understanding achieved. The results indicate that processes of meaning construction are reflected in patterns of eye movements during reading (1 st -pass) and re-reading (2 nd - and 3 rd -pass). From those, the position of the cut (after line 1 vs. after line 2) and, to some extent, the type of haiku (context--action vs. juxtaposition) can be `recovered'. Moreover, post-reading, readers tended to explicitly recognize a particular haiku they had read if they had been able to understand the poem, pointing to a role of actually resolving the haiku's meaning (rather than just attempting to resolve it) for memory consolidation and subsequent retrieval. Taken together, these first findings are promising, suggesting that haiku can be a paradigmatic material for studying meaning construction during poetry reading.}

Participants read eighty short story passages on a computer screen, each describing either a familiar or an unfamiliar event. Stories were written in the first or third person, and either featured or did not feature a shift in protagonist emotions in the last sentence of the text. The results indicated that the use of third-person narrative point-of-view had an overall effect on reading engagement and enhanced readers' ability to monitor changing character emotions. First-person narrative point-of-view, however, promoted protagonist empathy when participants read about unfamiliar events. The results also provide support for the conclusion that readers were more engaged with the story and constructed more effective situation models when they had prior personal experience of story events.},

  abstract = {Background: Considering components of the hidden curriculum in medicine in the higher education system is a useful adjunct to the formal curriculum since the learning and function of medical students are strongly affected by these components. The current study compares the hidden medical curriculum of Tabriz state and non-state Universities of Medical Sciences from the students' perspectives. Methods: In the current descriptive-comparative study, the statistical population included the total students of Tabriz state and non-state Universities of Medical Sciences. The statistical sample of the given study consisted of 400 students from senior and higher academic levels at the Tabriz state and non-state Universities of Medical Sciences based on Morgan's table. Two hundred students from each university were selected using stratified random sampling. The data collection tool was a researcher-created valid questionnaire. The validity and reliability of the given questionnaire in respect to its components were 0.94 and 0.76, respectively. In the analysis of data, an independent inferential T\_test was utilized. Results: The results of the analysis found that from the students' perspectives, the mean scores of the hidden curriculum in medicine in the Tabriz state university of medical sciences ranked the following components higher than the Tabriz non-state university of Medical Sciences: (1) Education, including curriculum and goal-setting, clinical education and content, (2) Socialphysical environment, (3) Regulations and rules, including reward and punishment system, organizational structure, respect for rights and value system and (4) Relations, including moral behavior, approach, participation, and responsibility. However, in the fifth component of contexts and perspectives, including personal-environment/family context and professional financial perspectives, there was no significant difference between the hidden curriculum of Tabriz state and non-state Universities of Medical Sciences. Conclusion: The components of the hidden curriculum in medicine affect the learning richness and function of students and should be taken into consideration by universities of medical sciences, particularly non-state universities.},

The first two subtasks are reruns from prior years and ask to predict the overall sentiment, and the sentiment towards a topic in a tweet. The three new subtasks focus on two variants of the basic ``sentiment classification in Twitter'' task. The first variant adopts a five-point scale, which confers an ordinal character to the classification task. The second variant focuses on the correct estimation of the prevalence of each class of interest, a task which has been called quantification in the supervised learning literature. The task continues to be very popular, attracting a total of 43 teams.},

From structured dialogue we can algorithmically determine who is speaking and guess at who is listening or being directly addressed. Knowing who is speaking to whom allows the flow of sentiment to be tracked between characters and, within plays with clear time-lines, permits tracking the development of emotional relationships. We hypothesize that changing polarities between characters can be modeled as edge weights in a dynamic social network- a "sentiment network"-which can be used to distinguish a document's genre (tragedies versus comedies), detect a given character's enemies and allies, and model the overall emotional development of a play. Experiments on Shakespeare's plays are presented along with discussion of improvements and further applications.},

These data provide an opportunity of developing many useful machine learning applications if the data could be transferred into a learn-able structure with appropriate labels for supervised learning. The annotation of this data has to be performed by qualified clinical experts, hence, limiting the use of this data due to the high cost of annotation. An underutilised technique of machine learning that can label new data called active learning (AL) is a promising candidate to address the high cost of the label the data. AL has been successfully applied to labelling speech recognition and text classification, however, there is a lack of literature investigating its use for clinical purposes. We performed a comparative investigation of various AL techniques using ML and deep learning (DL)-based strategies on three unique biomedical datasets. We investigated random sampling (RS), least confidence (LC), informative diversity and density (IDD), margin and maximum representativeness-diversity (MRD) AL query strategies. Our experiments show that AL has the potential to significantly reducing the cost of manual labelling. Furthermore, pre-labelling performed using AL expediates the labelling process by reducing the time required for labelling.},

  abstract = {Background Species occurrence records are very important in the biodiversity domain. While several available corpora contain only annotations of species names or habitats and geographical locations, there is no consolidated corpus that covers all types of entities necessary for extracting species occurrence from biodiversity literature. In order to alleviate this issue, we have constructed the COPIOUS corpus---a gold standard corpus that covers a wide range of biodiversity entities. Results Two annotators manually annotated the corpus with five categories of entities, i.e. taxon names, geographical locations, habitats, temporal expressions and person names. The overall inter-annotator agreement on 200 doubly-annotated documents is approximately 81.86\% F-score. Amongst the five categories, the agreement on habitat entities was the lowest, indicating that this type of entity is complex. The COPIOUS corpus consists of 668 documents downloaded from the Biodiversity Heritage Library with over 26K sentences and more than 28K entities. Named entity recognisers trained on the corpus could achieve an F-score of 74.58\%. Moreover, in recognising taxon names, our model performed better than two available tools in the biodiversity domain, namely the SPECIES tagger and the Global Name Recognition and Discovery. More than 1,600 binary relations of Taxon-Habitat, Taxon-Person, Taxon-Geographical locations and Taxon-Temporal expressions were identified by applying a pattern-based relation extraction system to the gold standard. Based on the extracted relations, we can produce a knowledge repository of species occurrences. Conclusion The paper describes in detail the construction of a gold standard named entity corpus for the biodiversity domain. An investigation of the performance of named entity recognition (NER) tools trained on the gold standard revealed that the corpus is sufficiently reliable and sizeable for both training and evaluation purposes. The corpus can be further used for relation extraction to locate species occurrences in literature---a useful task for monitoring species distribution and preserving the biodiversity.}

  abstract = {When we read literary fiction, we are transported to fictional places, and we feel and think along with the characters. Despite the importance of narrative in adult life and during development, the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying fiction comprehension are unclear. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how individuals differently employ neural networks important for understanding others' beliefs and intentions (mentalizing), and for sensori-motor simulation while listening to excerpts from literary novels. Localizer tasks were used to localize both the cortical motor network and the mentalizing network in participants after they listened to excerpts from literary novels. Results show that participants who had high activation in anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC; part of the mentalizing network) when listening to mentalizing content of literary fiction, had lower motor cortex activity when they listened to action-related content of the story, and vice versa. This qualifies how people differ in their engagement with fiction: some people are mostly drawn into a story by mentalizing about the thoughts and beliefs of others, whereas others engage in literature by simulating more concrete events such as actions. This study provides on-line neural evidence for the existence of qualitatively different styles of moving into literary worlds, and adds to a growing body of literature showing the potential to study narrative comprehension with neuroimaging methods.},

A number of initiatives have been made to overcome educational problems ranging from improving the curriculum, developing and increasing the quality of teachers, developing student abilities, and other efforts related to improving the quality of education. Based on the preliminary observation, students' critical thinking skills were considered low and a confirmatory study related to building critical thinking skills is necessary. This study analyzed critical thinking skills that are built based on perceptions of mobile media, self-directed learning, and digital literacy. The research method used was a quantitative approach by using a questionnaire instrument.. Data analysis included analyses of prerequisite tests including validity and reliability tests. The data were analyzed using the structural equation model (SEM) analysis. The results showed that 1) there was a positive and significant effect on the variable of perceptions on online learning media on self-directed learning and digital literacy, 2) there was a positive and significant effect on the variable of self-directed learning on critical thinking skills 3) there was a positive and significant effect on the variable of digital literacy on critical thinking skills 4) the variable of the perceptions on mobile-based learning media had a positive and significant effect on critical thinking skills through the mediation of self-directed learning and digital literacy.}

  abstract = {The Whitechapel murders that terrorized London in 1888 are still remembered to this day, thanks to the legend of its unapprehended perpetrator, Jack the Ripper. In addition to the gruesomeness of the murders, the name and the persona of the killer have been popularized by the over 200 letters signed as `Jack the Ripper' that have been received following the murders. The most supported theory on the authorship of these letters is that some of the earliest key texts were written by journalists to sell more newspapers and that the same person is responsible for writing the two most iconic earliest letters. The present article reports on an authorship clustering/verification analysis of the Jack the Ripper letters with a view to detect the presence of one writer for the earliest and most historically important texts. After compiling the `Jack the Ripper Corpus' consisting of the 209 letters linked to the case, a cluster analysis of the letters is carried out using the Jaccard distance of word 2-grams. The quantitative results and the discovery of certain shared distinctive lexicogrammatical structures support the hypothesis that the two most iconic texts responsible for the creation of the persona of Jack the Ripper were written by the same person. In addition, there is also evidence that a link exists between these texts and another of the key texts in the case, the Moab and Midian letter.},

Data discrimination is a real social problem. Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, especially women of color. Through an analysis of textual and media searches as well as extensive research on paid online advertising, Noble exposes a culture of racism and sexism in the way discoverability is created online. As search engines and their related companies grow in importance--operating as a source for email, a major vehicle for primary and secondary school learning, and beyond--understanding and reversing these disquieting trends and discriminatory practices are of utmost importance."--Page 4 of cover},

However, research into how HTR is changing our information environment is scant. This paper presents a systematic literature review regarding how researchers are using one particular HTR platform, Transkribus, to indicate the domains where HTR is applied, the approach taken, and how the technology is understood. 381 papers from 2015 to 2020 were gathered from Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science, then grouped and coded into categories using quantitative and qualitative approaches. Published research that mentions Transkribus is international and rapidly growing. Transkribus features primarily in archival and library science publications, while a long tail of broad and eclectic disciplines, including history, computer science, citizen science, law and education, demonstrate the wider applicability of the tool. The most common paper categories were               humanities applications               (67\%),               technological (25\%), users               (5\%) and               tutorials (3\%)               . This paper presents the first overarching review of HTR as featured in published research, while also elucidating how HTR is affecting the information environment.},

This study is perhaps the first linguistic oriented one to be carried out in sub-Saharan Africa and reveals an alternative health crisis communication method in sub-Saharan Africa. The research was guided by four main objectives which are: (1) To analyse the language models used in doctor--patient discourse. (2) To explain the dialogic nature of messages shared in Facebook Hypertension Support Groups. (3) To examine the function and impact of Facebook Hypertension Support Groups messages (4) To evaluate the High Blood Pressure patients' benefits and challenges of Hypertension Support Groups' communication. The theories underpinning this narrative qualitative research were the Multimodal Discourse Analysis and Dialogism. Data was collected through content/linguistic analysis of sampled and selected texts from Facebook Hypertension Support Groups. Interviews were also used. Purposive sampling was done in the selection of patients. The study revealed that the reciprocal emotional support characteristic of the Facebook Hypertension Support group is beneficial to the patients. More importantly, it was ascertained that the power balance between doctors and patients becomes more equalised, resulting in increased quality of clinical decisions.},

Results indicate that corrections frequently fail to reduce misperceptions among the targeted ideological group. We also document several instances of a ``backfire effect'' in which corrections actually increase misperceptions among the group in question.}

  abstract = {A taxonomy of emotions of literary response is presented. Some emotions occur as readers confront a text: they depend on curiosity as new material is assimilated to schemata, or on dishabituation as schemata accommodate. Further modes of emotion arise if readers enter the world of a story: they arise as a writer represents eliciting patterns of emotion and the reader responds with sympathy as story characters face these patterns, from personal memories of emotion, and by identification with characters' goals and plans. Based on cognitive theory and literary criticism, a theory of identification in fictional literature is presented, derived from Aristotle's concept mimesis. The usual translations, `imitation' or `representation', are misleading: mimesis means something closer to `simulation', as in computers. Fictional simulations run on people's minds. For them to run successfully readers (a) adopt a character's goals and use their own planning procedures to connect actions together meaningfully, (b) form mental models of imagined worlds, (c) receive speech acts addressed to them by the writer, and (d) integrate disparate elements to create a unified experience. In providing materials for these functions, great writers allow readers to respond creatively, to feel moved emotionally, to understand within themselves some of the relations between actions and emotions, and sometimes to undergo cognitive change.}

A potential explanation of these effects is offered by ``cognitive fluency theory,'' which stipulates that recurring patterns (e.g., meter) enhance perceptual fluency and can lead to greater aesthetic appreciation. In this article, we explore these two assertions by investigating the effects of meter and rhyme in the reception of poetry by means of event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Participants listened to four versions of lyrical stanzas that varied in terms of meter and rhyme, and rated the stanzas for rhythmicity and aesthetic liking. The behavioral and ERP results were in accord with enhanced liking and rhythmicity ratings for metered and rhyming stanzas. The metered and rhyming stanzas elicited smaller N400/P600 ERP responses than their nonmetered, nonrhyming, or nonmetered and nonrhyming counterparts. In addition, the N400 and P600 effects for the lyrical stanzas correlated with aesthetic liking effects (metered--nonmetered), implying that modulation of the N400 and P600 has a direct bearing on the aesthetic appreciation of lyrical stanzas. We suggest that these effects are indicative of perceptual-fluency-enhanced aesthetic liking, as postulated by cognitive fluency theory.}

Individual differences in working memory capacity (WMC), need for cognition (NFC), and cognitive-affective processing were measured. The results showed that the processing of metaphors was characterized by slow-down during first-pass reading of the utterances, whereas sarcasm produced mainly delayed effects in the eye movement records. Sarcastic utterances were also harder to comprehend than literal or metaphorical utterances as indicated by poorer performance in responses to inference questions. Individual differences in general cognitive factors (WMC and NFC) were related to the processing of metaphors, whereas individual differences in both general cognitive factors (WMC) as well as processing of emotional information were related to the processing of sarcasm. The results indicate that different forms of figurative language pose different cognitive demands to the reader, and show that reader characteristics play a prominent role in figurative language comprehension.},

The issue of what constitutes free indirect discourse is discussed, the relevance of syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic accounts is assessed, and a three-tiered interpretation of its functions (including the integrative, evaluative, and referential functions) is proposed. The integrative and evaluative functions emphasize free indirect discourse as a bivocal or polyvocal mode, while the referential functions are seen to be relevant because they enable a more satisfactory conceptualization of free indirect discourse as the representation of verbal acts and preverbal or nonverbal mental acts. Free indirect discourse is therefore viewed not as report but as representation, a broader category which subsumes not only the rendition of verbal events, but nonverbal mental events as well.}

The present study used event-related functional MRI to investigate whether the brain areas associated with successful episodic encoding of words in a semantic study task are a subset of those demonstrating depth of processing effects. In addition, we tested whether the brain areas associated with successful episodic encoding differ depending on the nature of the study task. At study, 15 volunteers were cued to make either animacy or alphabetical decisions about words. A recognition memory test including confidence judgements followed after a delay of 15 min. Prefrontal and medial temporal regions showed greater functional MRI activations for semantically encoded words relative to alphabetically encoded words. Two of these regions (left anterior hippocampus and left ventral inferior frontal gyrus) showed greater activation for semantically encoded words that were subsequently recognized confidently. However, other regions (left posterior hippocampus and right inferior frontal cortex) demonstrated subsequent memory effects, but not effects of depth of processing. Successful memory for alphabetically encoded words was also associated with greater activation in the left anterior hippocampus and left ventral inferior frontal gyrus. The findings suggest that episodic encoding for words in a semantic study task involves a subset of the regions activated by deep relative to shallow processing. The data provide little evidence that successful episodic encoding during a shallow study task depends upon regions different from those that support the encoding of deeply studied words. Instead, the findings suggest that successful episodic encoding during a shallow study task relies on a subset of the regions engaged during successful encoding in a deep task.},

In silent reading, we found in 2 experiments that reading times on target words were shortened with semantic previews in early and late processing, whereas phonological preview effects mainly occurred in gaze duration or second-pass reading. In contrast, results showed that phonological preview information is obtained early on in oral reading. Strikingly, in oral reading, we observed a semantic preview cost on the target word in Experiment 1 and a decrease in the effect size of preview benefit from first- to second-pass measures in Experiment 2, which we hypothesize to result from increased preview duration. Taken together, our results indicate that parafoveal semantic information can be obtained irrespective of reading mode, whereas readers more efficiently process parafoveal phonological information in oral reading. We discuss implications for notions of information processing priority and saccade generation during silent and oral reading.}

Design/methodology/approach               This study conducted an online survey with the participation of 759 individuals, to examine the influence of privacy concerns, self-esteem and the chosen SNS platform, on the shaping of the digital identity, through a classification of identity elements that users disclose when using a SNS, the Rosenberg self-esteem scale and relevant constructs from the literature.                                         Findings               Findings reveal that users consider the name, gender, picture, interests and job as most important elements for shaping their digital identity. They also demonstrate that privacy concerns do not seem to affect the amount of information users choose to publish when shaping their digital identity. Specific characteristics of SNS platforms are found to affect the way that users shape their digital identity and their privacy behavior. Finally, self-esteem was found to affect privacy concerns and digital identity formation.                                         Research limitations/implications               To avoid a lengthy questionnaire and the risk of low participation, the respondents answered the questions for one SNS of their choice instead of answering the full questionnaire for each SNS that they use. The survey included the most popular SNSs at the time of the survey in terms of popularity.                                         Practical implications               The results contribute to the theory by furthering our knowledge on the elements that shape digital identity and by providing evidence with regard to the role of privacy and self-esteem within social networking. In practice, they can be useful for SNS providers, as well as for entities that design security and privacy awareness campaigns.                                         Originality/value               This paper identifies novel factors that influence digital identity formation, including the specific SNS used with its particular characteristics in combination with privacy concerns and self-esteem of the user.},

  abstract = {The popularity of literary biographies and the importance publishers place on author publicity materials suggest the concept of an author's creative intentions is important to readers' appreciation of literary works. However, the question of how this kind of contextual information informs literary interpretation is contentious. One area of dispute concerns the extent to which readers' constructions of an author's creative intentions are text-centred and therefore can adequately be understood by linguistic evidence alone. The current study shows how the relationship between linguistic and contextual factors in readers' constructions of an author's creative intentions may be investigated empirically. We use eye-tracking to determine whether readers' responses to textual features (changes to lexis and punctuation) are affected by prior, extra-textual prompts concerning information about an author's creative intentions. We showed participants pairs of sentences from Oscar Wilde and Henry James while monitoring their eye movements. The first sentence was followed by a prompt denoting a different attribution (Authorial, Editorial/Publisher and Typographic) for the change that, if present, would appear in the second sentence. After reading the second sentence, participants were asked whether they had detected a change and, if so, to describe it. If the concept of an author's creative intentions is implicated in literary reading this should influence participants' reading behaviour and ability to accurately report a change based on the prompt. The findings showed that readers' noticing of textual variants was sensitive to the prior prompt about its authorship, in the sense of producing an effect on attention and re-reading times. But they also showed that these effects did not follow the pattern predicted of them, based on prior assumptions about readers' cultures. This last finding points to the importance, as well as the challenges, of further investigating the role of contextual information in readers' constructions of an author's creative intentions.},

In spite of this potential improvement, the cost of building a domain-specific sentiment lexicon hinders its wider and more practical applications. To compensate for this difficulty, we propose extracting a sentiment lexicon from a domain-specific corpus by annotating an intelligently selected subset of documents in the corpus. Specifically, the subset is selected by an active learner with initializations from diverse text analytics, i.e. latent Dirichlet allocation and our proposed lexicon coverage algorithm. This active learning produces a better domain-specific sentiment lexicon which results in a higher accuracy of the sentiment classification. Subsequently, we evaluate extracted sentiment lexicons by observing (1) the increased F1 measure in sentiment classifications and (2) the increased similarity to the sentiment lexicon with the full annotation. We expect that this contribution will enable more accurate sentiment classification by domain-specific sentiment lexicons with less sentiment tagging efforts.},

Despite readers' potential glimpse into the future, it is not clear if and how this bottom-up information aids top-down prediction. The current study manipulated the predictability of target words and their location on a line of text. Targets were located in the middle of the line (preview available) or as the first word on a new line (preview unavailable). This represents an innovative method for manipulating parafoveal preview which utilises return sweeps to deny access to parafoveal preview of target words without the use of invalid previews. The study is the first to demonstrate gaze duration word predictability effects in the absence of parafoveal preview.}

In the current study, eye movement behavior was studied in seventy-six Chilean high school students, who read a set of twelve causally-related economics texts in Spanish in four experimental conditions. The objective is twofold. We aimed, on the one hand, to observe the main effects of the causal discourse marker (DM) por tanto and the statistical causal graph (G), as well as the interaction effect of both variables on different eye tracking measures. On the other, we seek to observe the effects of the DM on the same eye tracking measures for the graph system (GS) area of interest (AOI). The findings showed that the conjoint presence of the DM and the G did not positively influence the processing of selected AOIs. Analyses also reveal no significant effects on the GS AOI. Thus, the results indicate that the DM tend to decrease processing times, while the G increases them. Additional analyses conducted on the integrative transitions between the verbal system and the graph system reveal that more transitions were identified between the consequence segment and the graph system, thereby confirming that the consequence segment is crucial for the integration of both semiotic systems.},

We examined different network properties that might affect the successful dissemination by and adoption of public health messages from public health officials and health agencies.                                         Methods:               We focused on conversations on Twitter during 3 key communication events from late January to early June of 2020. We used Netlytic, a Web-based software that collects publicly available data from social media sites such as Twitter.                                         Results:               We found that the network of conversations around COVID-19 is highly decentralized, fragmented, and loosely connected; these characteristics can hinder the successful dissemination of public health messages in a network. Competing conversations and misinformation can hamper risk communication efforts in a way that imperil public health.                                         Conclusions:               Looking at basic metrics might create a misleading picture of the effectiveness of risk communication efforts on social media if not analyzed within the context of the larger network. Social network analysis of conversations on social media should be an integral part of how public health officials and agencies plan, monitor, and evaluate risk communication efforts.},

Drawing on both bodies of research, this study set out to ascertain the public image and understanding of the profession and to begin to identify possible links between these perceptions and use of digital technologies. The article discusses the results of a survey of the Western Washington University campus community designed to identify possible correlations between Internet usage, other means of encountering archives, and perceptions of archives. Findings provide an overall picture of perceptions of archives, including expectations for access, perceptions of the value of archives, and the general image and understandings of archives and archivists. Results also show correlations between these perceptions and expectations for digital access to information, as well as with the places respondents encountered archives.]}

I provide a theoretical framework for studying venues for humanities work drawing on the phenomenological approach to the concepts of place and space, the pedagogical perspective on learning spaces in higher education, and epistemological studies of scientific places. Next, I analyse the landscape for the reconfiguration of humanities venues and present arguments for engaging with space by referring to the functioning of digital humanities. This essay shows that place is an extremely important resource, seeing as it is endowed with the power to drive new practices, institutionalize a community, and consolidate a discipline. Therefore, humanists should reflect critically on the ?architecture of the humanities? and engage in making their own spaces that determine practices, communication, and well-being.}

The ways people use words in their writing and in everyday life reflect people's social and psychological states. Whereas most text analysis research has focused on the content of people's writings, the current paper demonstrates that almost-invisible function words can be psychologically relevant as well. Through the analysis of pronouns, prepositions, and other function words used in literature, several studies demonstrate how authors' emotional states, aging processes, theories of mind, and the nature of their romantic and collaborative relationships are revealed through their words. The function word approach provides a glimpse of the rapidly expanding methods available to psychologists interested in tracking the social and psychological worlds of authors. With the upcoming release of data sets such as Google Books, the analysis of literature will likely serve as a foundational method used in the fields of psychology, linguistics, history, and other areas of the behavioral and social sciences.},

However there are 4 clear contributions of cognitive research: (1) contrary to the belief that context allows readers to just sample a small of words in a text, skilled reader read most words rather than skip the words; (2) contrary to the belief that poor reading arises from a failure to use context, less skilled readers rely heavily on context; (3) contrary to a belief that the sounds of words (their phonology) are irrelevant once children learn to read, skilled readers use phonology in reading; (4) contrary to the view that learning to read is only or mainly about "meaning making," children learn to read successfully by learning how their writing system works.},

The Hobongan typically acknowledge the lack of 					parity and ignore it, or they accept the lack of parity and try to rejoin polyphony through conversion. Syncretism presents a more 					complex case because dialogue remains possible: both Hobongan and Christian-influenced practices are combined to avoid unpleasant 					dialogues.},

  abstract = {Measuring the polarization of legislators and parties is a key step in understanding how politics develops over time. But in parliamentary systems---where ideological positions estimated from roll calls may not be informative---producing valid estimates is extremely challenging. We suggest a new measurement strategy that makes innovative use of the ``accuracy'' of machine classifiers, i.e., the number of correct predictions made as a proportion of all predictions. In our case, the ``labels'' are the party identifications of the members of parliament, predicted from their speeches along with some information on debate subjects. Intuitively, when the learner is able to discriminate members in the two main Westminster parties well, we claim we are in a period of ``high'' polarization. By contrast, when the classifier has low accuracy---and makes a relatively large number of mistakes in terms of allocating members to parties based on the data---we argue parliament is in an era of ``low'' polarization. This approach is fast and substantively valid, and we demonstrate its merits with simulations, and by comparing the estimates from 78 years of House of Commons speeches with qualitative and quantitative historical accounts of the same. As a headline finding, we note that contemporary British politics is approximately as polarized as it was in the mid-1960s---that is, in the middle of the ``postwar consensus''. More broadly, we show that the technical performance of supervised learning algorithms can be directly informative about substantive matters in social science.},

The study of illiterate subjects represents one approach to investigating the interactions between neurobiological and cultural factors in cognitive development, individual learning, and their influence on the functional organization of the brain. In this chapter, we review some recent cognitive, neuroanatomic, and functional neuroimaging results indicating that formal education influences important aspects of the human brain. Taken together, this provides strong support for the idea that the brain is modulated by literacy and formal education, which in turn change the brain's capacity to interact with its environment, including the individual's contemporary culture. In other words, the individual is able to participate in, interact with, and actively contribute to the process of cultural transmission in new ways through acquired cognitive skills.INTRODUCTIONEducation plays an essential role in contemporary society. Acquiring reading and writing skills, as well as other cognitive skills, during formal education can be viewed as a structured process of cultural transmission. Formal education and the educational system represent essential aspects of modern society and are cardinal structures of the intelligent information environment. These institutionalized structures subserve important aspects of socialization and cultural transmission. The study of illiterate subjects and matched literate controls provides an opportunity to investigate the interaction between neurobiological and cultural factors in cognitive development and learning.},

  abstract = {The present research examines the effects of body-object interaction (BOI) on eye gaze behaviour in a reading task. BOI measures perceptions of the ease with which a human body can physically interact with a word's referent. A set of high BOI words (e.g. cat) and a set of low BOI words (e.g. sun) were selected, matched on imageability and concreteness (as well as other lexical and semantic variables). Facilitatory BOI effects were observed: gaze durations and total fixation durations were shorter for high BOI words, and participants made fewer regressions to high BOI words. The results provide evidence of a BOI effect on non-manual responses and in a situation that taps normal reading processes. We discuss how the results (a) suggest that stored motor information (as measured by BOI ratings) is relevant to lexical semantics, and (b) are consistent with an embodied view of cognition (Wilson 2002).},

  abstract = {Modern cartography has the ability to map almost any phenomenon for which spatial relationships are of primary relevance. While existing cartographic products cover already an enormous variety of topics, the visualisation of `other' geographies gains more and more attention. These other geographies may not accord to the `normal' spaces usually mapped, hence cartography is both challenged and forced to find uncommon solutions. Literature and its fictional spaces might serve as a fi ne example (but one could also think of soundscapes or emotions). Doubtlessly, the realm of fiction is defined by different `rules' to the geography that cartography customarily addresses. This paper deals with two main questions: Firstly, how to map narratives and their complex spatial structure? Secondly, what do we achieve by mapping literature? By searching for some (provisional) answers, the horizon of a promising interdisciplinary research field -- a future literary geography -- becomes visible.},

On the initially favored analysis, a noun phrase served as the object of the preceding verb. On the ultimately correct analysis, it served as the subject of a main clause in Experiments 1 and 3 and of a complement clause in Experiment 2. If the object analysis was implausible, disruption occurred during processing of the noun phrase. If it was plausible, disruption occurred after disambiguation. In Experiment 3, discourse context affected plausibility of the initial analysis and subsequent reanalysis. The authors argue that readers performed substantial semantic processing on the initial analysis and committed strongly when it was plausible. Experiment 3 showed that these effects were not due to selectional restrictions or word co-occurrences and that the interpretation of the target sentence was not computed in isolation.

A 3rd experiment used unambiguous verbs. The results indicated that the language processor used information about context in the early stages of resolving meaning ambiguities but only during integration for sense ambiguities. Effects of preference were delayed for both types of verbs. The results contrast with findings concerning the processing of nouns (e.g., K. Rayner \& S. A. Duffy, 1986). For meaning ambiguities, the authors argue that delays in resolution allow both meanings to reach a high level of activation, thus reducing effects of frequency. For sense ambiguities, the authors argue that the processor does not access multiple senses but activates one underspecified meaning and uses context to home in on the appropriate sense.

Nevertheless, in early stages 					of the language we find               nunca               with a non-negative interpretation, in contexts that are considered ungrammatical 					in contemporary Portuguese. Unlike negative indefinites that started as weak NPIs and became inherently negative,               nunca               was already a strong negative polarity item in 13th century Portuguese. In this article I will show 					that, apart from the strong NPI               nunca               , there was also an ambiguous item               nunca               that corresponded 					to a modal polarity item. In the Romance context, items originating from Latin               numquam               also unfold into ambiguous 					items with different polarity. In Portuguese, however, ambiguity was not preserved. The evolution of               nunca               reinforces the idea that Portuguese is the most innovative of Romance languages regarding the outcomes of polarity items.},

For millennia, we have been debating whether there are inherent features of being fictional or whether it is simply a matter of intention, that perhaps there is nothing unique to the language of fictional discourse after all.

To understand such an elliptical construction, the listener arguably must `fill in' the missing material (``the handyman threw\_\_\_ to the programmer'') based on that which occurs in the antecedent clause. We aimed to determine the point in time in which reconstruction of the sluiced sentence is attempted and whether such a complex antecedent is re-accessed by the ellipsis. Out of the two antecedent constituents for which we probed, only the Object (programmer) was found active in the elliptical clause, confirming that an antecedent is attributed to the sluice in real time. Possible reasons for the non-observation of the Subject (handyman) are considered. We also suggest that ellipses are detected earlier in coordinated than subordinated sentences.}

We discuss how the model is being used to examine two fundamental questions related to reading: (1) What mediates the development of reading skill? (2) What is the time course of lexical processing? Simulations using the model suggest that very rapid lexical processing is necessary for skilled reading and that this processing must also be highly coordinated with other ongoing perceptual, cognitive, and motor processes. Thus a significant portion of the lexical processing of a word is completed while it is still in the parafovea (prior to the word being fixated). The implications of these conclusions are discussed, as are future directions in modeling the cognitive processes that control eye movements during reading.

The chapters in this Handbook synthesize the research on these topics, focusing on how studies using a cognitive approach can shed light on how the reading process works in skilled readers and how children learn to read. To set the stage, the first few chapters of the Handbook present information about writing systems and about methods of studying reading, including those that examine speeded responses to individual words and those that use eye movement technology to examine the reading of sentences and texts. The chapters in the following section focus on the identification of single words by skilled readers. Insights that have been gained from studies of adults with reading disabilities due to brain damage are also discussed. Another section of the Handbook considers the silent reading of text by skilled readers. The chapters in this section address such issues as the role of sound in silent reading and how readers' eyes move through texts, and detailed quantitative models of the reading process are proposed in some chapters. How children learn to read and spell and how they should be taught to do so is the focus of the chapters in the final sections of the Handbook. These chapters review research with learners of different languages and those who speak different dialects of a language; they discuss both typically developing children and children with specific disabilities in reading. These chapters also address questions about how reading should be taught with populations ranging from preschoolers to adolescents, and they show how research findings have influenced education.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Human experience is inherently temporal and involves placing events, symbols, and actions in a temporal scheme. This article deals with a specific aspect of temporal experience as it relates to reading and experiencing narrative fiction. Within an enactive understanding of human cognition, we propose a view of literary reading as a process of participatory sense-making between a reader and a storyteller. The enactive theory of participatory sense-making maintains that agents, by enacting their own sense-making, directly and partially constitute the sense-making of other agents. Sense-makers in interaction navigate two orders of normativity: their own and that of the interaction itself. Linguistic sense-making (languaging) opens up further possibilities for understanding complex spatially and temporally distributed forms of social interactions such as narrative interactions. Reading a narrative is one such example of mutually constituted navigation between an interaction dynamic and interactors' sense-making. The reader completes and co-authors emergent textual meaning and a textually emerging storyteller guides and anticipates the multiple temporal displacements, realized linguistically, that a reader has to experience in the process of reading. We explore the participatory structure of a narrative through its temporal unfolding and the specific, non-linear nature of the temporal dynamics of interacting with a storytelling agency. In particular, narrative interactions are seen as modulations in the pacing of a given narrative's unfolding. It is suggested that the reader's enactment of such temporally realized pacings constitutes a better description of narrative immersion than its traditional understanding as a simulation of spatial situatedness.},

To achieve this aim development and research of the Borg and Gall (Gall et al., 2007) model continued with the experimental research conducted using one group pre- and post-test design. Instrument tests of mathematical critical thinking skills and student perception questionnaires were employed to collect data. The findings indicate that the digital book STEM PjBL is valid and significant in fostering students' critical thinking skills and has a positive impact on other 21st-century learning skills.

Design/methodology/approach               This exploratory study uses a qualitative method by observing five different social ventures in Indonesia. The case study involves observation of social enterprises that concern digital humanities projects and interviews with those who manage the crowdfunding for financing the projects as the key respondents. The analysis uses an interpretative approach by involving the respondents to explain the phenomena.                                         Findings               (1) Adopting the crowdfunding platform encourages social enterprises to reshape social missions with more responsive action for digital humanities. (2) Crowdfunding allows social enterprises to share the risk with stakeholders who focus on fostering the social impact of digital humanities. (3) Crowdfunding stimulates social enterprises to hire professional workers with flexible work arrangements to attract specific donors and investors.                                         Originality/value               The result extends the principles of social enterprises by introducing some concepts of crowdfunding in digital humanities.

Using a framework derived from work in human geography and information science, we illustrate how there is more to place than names and coordinates. Through a set of case studies we explore different aspects of the seemingly trivial query `mountains in the Alps' addressing a range of issues including ambiguity, the use of vernacular names, ways in which concepts such as mountain are used in different locations and by different groups, approaches to automatically generating macro-maps in space and time and, finally, techniques allowing regions to be characterised and compared based on the terms used to describe them. The use of all these methods in combination allows us to come closer to a meaningful representation of place in the sense of human geography within the context of Geographic Information Science. However, our approaches focus on the naming of places and their material or perceivable properties, and there is still much work to do to properly represent place, and particularly sense of place. Nonetheless, we suggest that such approaches have considerable potential for those working in the digital humanities, and especially those concerned with contributing to a spatial turn therein.},

  abstract = {Understanding the role of humans in environmental change is one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century. Environmental narratives - written texts with a focus on the environment - offer rich material capturing relationships between people and surroundings. We take advantage of two key opportunities for their computational analysis: massive growth in the availability of digitised contemporary and historical sources, and parallel advances in the computational analysis of natural language. We open by introducing interdisciplinary research questions related to the environment and amenable to analysis through written sources. The reader is then introduced to potential collections of narratives including newspapers, travel diaries, policy documents, scientific proposals and even fiction. We demonstrate the application of a range of approaches to analysing natural language computationally, introducing key ideas through worked examples, and providing access to the sources analysed and accompanying code. The second part of the book is centred around case studies, each applying computational analysis to some aspect of environmental narrative. Themes include the use of language to describe narratives about glaciers, urban gentrification, diversity and writing about nature and ways in which locations are conceptualised and described in nature writing. We close by reviewing the approaches taken, and presenting an interdisciplinary research agenda for future work. The book is designed to be of interest to newcomers to the field and experienced researchers, and set out in a way that it can be used as an accompanying text for graduate level courses in, for example, geography, environmental history or the digital humanities},

Although many AC researchers have traditionally attempted to remain agnostic to the different emotion theories proposed by psychologists, the affective technologies being developed are rife with theoretical assumptions that impact their effectiveness. Hence, an informed and integrated examination of emotion theories from multiple areas will need to become part of computing practice if truly effective real-world systems are to be achieved. This survey discusses theoretical perspectives that view emotions as expressions, embodiments, outcomes of cognitive appraisal, social constructs, products of neural circuitry, and psychological interpretations of basic feelings. It provides meta-analyses on existing reviews of affect detection systems that focus on traditional affect detection modalities like physiology, face, and voice, and also reviews emerging research on more novel channels such as text, body language, and complex multimodal systems. This survey explicitly explores the multidisciplinary foundation that underlies all AC applications by describing how AC researchers have incorporated psychological theories of emotion and how these theories affect research questions, methods, results, and their interpretations. In this way, models and methods can be compared, and emerging insights from various disciplines can be more expertly integrated.},

  abstract = {Children have considerable difficulty producing informative and unambiguous referring expressions, a fact that still lacks a full explanation. Potential insight can come from psycholinguistic models of ambiguity avoidance in adults, which suggest that, before describing any scene, speakers pro-actively monitor for some --- but not all --- types of potential ambiguity, and then subsequently monitor whether their just-produced expression provides an ambiguous description. Our experiments used eye tracking to assess the developing roles of these skills in children's referential communication. Experiment 1 shows that adults' eye movements can index the processes of both pro-active and self-monitoring. Experiments 2 and 3 show that children (n=110) typically do not pro-actively monitor for potential ambiguity, although they do show evidence of pro-active monitoring on the occasions when they produce informative expressions. However, we do find evidence that children consistently monitor their own descriptions for ambiguity, even though they rarely correct their utterances. We propose that the process of self-monitoring might act as a learning signal, that guides children as they acquire the ability to monitor pro-actively.},

  abstract = {(from the chapter) This chapter first reviews studies that used oculomotor analyses to study reading development in general. We then examine in detail some important similarities and differences between silent and oral reading. Based on data recently collected in our group, a cross-linguistic perspective to this discussion is added that may help to illuminate how the context of a particular language codetermines the task of becoming a skilled reader. Although our discussion focuses on eye movement data, we are aware that other important approaches to the study of reading development and its underlying mechanisms exist. There is a strong and successful tradition of psychometric assessments, using performance measures to examine the development of reading fluency and comprehension. Similarly, tasks that are considered component skills of reading are frequently examined to uncover cognitive mechanisms underlying normal and abnormal reading development. Both of these approaches are represented in this volume with chapters written by leading experts in the field. Looking at reading more from a basic science angle, vibrant fields of experimental research use single-word paradigms (now often combined with brain imaging techniques) to study word processing, asking in many cases questions that parallel those raised in oculomotor studies (e.g., Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, \& Ziegler, 2001; Jacobs \& Grainger, 1994). At this point in the history of our field, these different theoretical traditions and methodological approaches are still largely in a state of friendly coexistence. We hope that the present volume will serve to help unite the field and that our chapter can make a contribution in this direction.

We operationalize this notion via a proxy, tracing the use of verbs relating to inner life across 10 language corpora from the ELTeC collection, which comprises novels from the period between 1840--1920. We expected to find an increase in the use of inner-life verbs corresponding to the traditional periodisation of modernism in each of the languages. However, different experiments conducted with the data do not confirm this hypothesis. We therefore look at the results in a number of more granular ways, but we cannot identify any common trends even when we split the verbs into individual categories, or take canonicity or gender into account. We discuss the obtained results in detail, proposing potential reasons for them and including potential avenues of further research as well as lessons learned.},

Both in science and policy, this interaction has been dealt with in a fragmented way, depending on the objectives, the disciplinary perspective, as well as the used conceptual backdrop. In this wider framework, landscape identity emerges in policy discourses as a powerful argument to value landscape but it lacks an operationalised framework for policymaking. This paper has two major goals. One is to review the conceptual dialogue between landscape's and people's identity. The other is to identify contents of identity in the landscape (i.e. attributes used to define landscape identity) and the complexity of the identity (i.e. dimensions used to define landscape identity) as a way to increase efficiency in more spatially targeted policies. Above all, this paper discusses how landscape identity has been approached, in order to get an improved understanding of its potential for introducing the landscape concept at multiple levels of governance and how an increased knowledge base might be useful to inform policy making.},

The study investigates its knowledge and truth claims, approach to data, transparency practices, and resources invested to claim reliable knowledge. The epistemology is characterized by innovative practices in the visualizing of essentially prejustified datasets. It claims public value offering general information and audience-friendly explorations of individual perspectives on topics on the public agenda. The approach to data views reality as measurable facts yet indicates epistemic ambiguity regarding figures' reliability, guided by a principle of reasonableness in the justifications of truth claims.},

Measuring eye movements during reading is one of the most precise methods for measuring moment-by-moment (online) processing demands during text comprehension. Cognitive processing demands are reflected by several aspects of eye movement behavior, such as fixation duration, number of fixations, and number of regressions (returning to prior parts of a text). Important properties of eye tracking equipment that researchers need to consider are described, including how frequently the eye position is measured (sampling rate), accuracy of determining eye position, how much head movement is allowed, and ease of use. Also described are properties of stimuli that influence eye movements that need to be controlled in studies of text comprehension, such as the position, frequency, and length of target words. Procedural recommendations related to preparing the participant, setting up and calibrating the equipment, and running a study are given. Representative results are presented to illustrate how data can be evaluated. Although the methodology is described in terms of reading comprehension, much of the information presented can be applied to any study in which participants read verbal stimuli.},

In this work, Hindi Dependency Parser (HDP) is used to determine the association between an aspect word and a sentiment word (using Hindi SentiWordNet) and works on the idea that closely connected words come together to express a sentiment about a certain aspect. By generating a dependency graph, the system assigns the sentiment to an aspect having a minimum distance between them and computes the overall polarity of the sentence. The system achieves an accuracy of 83.2\% on a corpus of movie reviews and its results are compared with baselines as well as existing works on SA. From the results, it has been observed that the proposed system has the potential to be used in emerging applications like SA of product reviews, social media analysis, etc.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            For specialists and non-specialists alike, maps are one of the central ways that the environment becomes visible and comprehensible. Since the 1960s, both the practice and the values of environmental mapping have been transformed by new algorithmic methods for turning point-by-point measurements into a smooth cartographic image, especially when visualising the invisible geographies of pollution, climate change, and underground resources. The resulting maps are now ubiquitous. This article argues that algorithmic methods - especially those created by a small group of French mining engineers and installed widely in software by the 1990s - shifted the values and meaning of environmental mapping away from a traditional concern with qualitative               realism               to a new emphasis on quantitative               accuracy               . This was a shift not just in the goals of mapping but in the kind of environment that maps ultimately construct. The prioritisation of accuracy should therefore not be seen as a straightforward improvement, as its associated values raise difficult conceptual problems, both historical and historiographic, about scale, expertise and the role of human judgement in the creation of environmental fact. Historicising the techniques and meanings of mapping is especially important as environmental historians consider new geospatial methods - including algorithmic methods - in their own work.},

  abstract = {Context               The hidden curriculum is a learning dimension made up of culturally acquired, unintended lessons. Although nurse educators are not fully aware of it, through the hidden curriculum students are prepared for adult professional roles, internalising professional values and developing a professional identity. However, academic nursing education has paid relatively scarce attention to it. The objective was to map the nursing education literature about the hidden curriculum and to identify and verify to which of the four areas suggested by Hafferty (institutional policies, resource allocation decisions, institutional slang and evaluation) it refers.                                         Methods                                A scoping study was conducted. In July 2018, a search was performed in MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO/ Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Cochrane Library databases, without time or language restrictions. Two authors independently performed the selection of studies, which followed the                 p                 referred                 r                 eporting                 i                 tems for                 s                 ystematic                 r                 eviews and                 m                 eta-analysis (PRISMA) flowchart.

Results               The study included 18 articles, 13 of which were published during the last 5~years. A total of 12 were research articles, 10 of which used qualitative methodology. Regarding the area of analysis, all four areas could be identified within nursing education literature. The most widely explored area proved to be institutional policies, mentioned by 15 articles, predominantly to highlight the negative effect of the hidden curriculum. Some relational aspects, attributed to the hidden curriculum within nursing literature, belong to the informal~curriculum.                                         Conclusions               The hidden curriculum in nursing education remains a largely overlooked topic. It appears to be a broader concept than that theorised by Hafferty, often also encompassing the informal curriculum. Furthermore, the literature reviewed mostly highlights the negative consequences of the hidden curriculum, such as the difficulty of transmitting professional values and ethics. Conversely, future researchers should concentrate on its positive consequences as a way to limit the loss of professional values.                        ,              Through a scoping review, Raso et al. help to clarify the concept of the hidden curriculum as it is represented in the nursing literature.},

Choropleth maps suggest that political borders are clear and uniform, but early modern politics was characterized by ill-defined and overlapping political spheres. This study uses interactive maps to explore the case of composite state borders in early modern Japan. Using points, rather than polygons, to represent villages, we reproduce how Tokugawa-era officials understood political space primarily as population nodes, not as clearly defined polygons. In lieu of conventional borders, we calculate Voronoi polygons to show where political authority was spatially fragmented. Using logit analysis we show that increased spatial contiguity allowed lords (daimyo) to establish monopolies and tax their holdings more intensively. Other factors, such as the lord's rank, figure prominently in the historiography, but can not be substantiated in our analysis.},

  abstract = {The prospect of speed reading--reading at an increased speed without any loss of comprehension--has undeniable appeal. Speed reading has been an intriguing concept for decades, at least since Evelyn Wood introduced her Reading Dynamics training program in 1959. It has recently increased in popularity, with speed-reading apps and technologies being introduced for smartphones and digital devices. The current article reviews what the scientific community knows about the reading process--a great deal--and discusses the implications of the research findings for potential students of speed-reading training programs or purchasers of speed-reading apps. The research shows that there is a trade-off between speed and accuracy. It is unlikely that readers will be able to double or triple their reading speeds (e.g., from around 250 to 500-750 words per minute) while still being able to understand the text as well as if they read at normal speed. If a thorough understanding of the text is not the reader's goal, then speed reading or skimming the text will allow the reader to get through it faster with moderate comprehension. The way to maintain high comprehension and get through text faster is to practice reading and to become a more skilled language user (e.g., through increased vocabulary). This is because language skill is at the heart of reading speed.},

In this article, we argue that DSR offers unique possibilities for research into literature, reading, the impact of reading and literary communication. We also claim that in this context computational tools are especially relevant, making DSR a field particularly suitable for the application of Digital Humanities methods. We draw up an initial categorization of research aspects of DSR and briefly examine literature for each category. We distinguish between studies on DSR that use it as a lens to study wider processes of literary exchange as opposed to studies for which the DSR culture is a phenomenon interesting in its own right. Via seven examples of DSR research, we discuss the chosen approaches and their connection to research questions in literary studies.},

It seems to be a mixture of both direct discourse (in allowing exclamatives, interrogatives, etc.) and indirect discourse (in following sequences of tenses and pronouns). It has been the object of more interest from literary theorists than from linguists, though Banfield (1982) offered what is still the best syntactic description of the phenomenon, and contemporary semantic accounts have brought new insights into it. Schlenker (2004) made decisive progress in proposing an account of two contexts and indexical shifting. Maier (2015) proposes an alternative quotational analyses, which Eckardt (2015) rejects, going back to Schlenker's model, suitably amended to answer Maier's criticism. We present these theories, criticize them, and propose an extension of the Schlenker--Eckardt model.}

Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants read words organized in an orthogonal design with the factors valence (positive, negative, neutral) and arousal (low, medium, high) in a lexical decision task. We observed faster reaction times for words of positive valence and for those of high arousal. Data from ERPs showed increased early posterior negativity (EPN) suggesting improved visual processing of these conditions. Valence effects appeared for medium and low arousal and were absent for high arousal. Arousal effects were obtained for neutral and negative words but were absent for positive words. These results suggest independent contributions of arousal and valence at early attentional stages of processing. Arousal effects preceded valence effects in the ERP data suggesting that arousal serves as an early alert system preparing a subsequent evaluation in terms of valence.},

Recent       research       reveals       that       affective/emotional  factors  and  confirmation  bias  prevail  in  how  users  interact  with  media  content.  This  paper  draws  on  the  conceptions  of  the  affective  turn  (Clough,  2010),  the  embodied  mind  (Varela  1990),  and  the  concept  of  radical  mediation  (Grusin,  2015)  to  demonstrate  how  the  body  and  affect  act  in  interaction  with  the  media,  producing  a  kind  of  intensification     of     affective     interpersonal     relationships,     generating states of mind that circulate and influence people's reactions   to   facts   and   opinions.   It   highlights   how   non-conscious  aspects  affect  conscious  thinking.  It  is  concluded  that   strategies   based   on   rhetorical   and   sociolinguistic   structures   are   insufficient   to   combat   disinformation.   It   is   necessary to carry out inter and transdisciplinary research that adds  bodily  and  affective  factors  to  the  ways  in  which  users  engage with the media.},

These findings have been used to support claims about the role of linguistic constraints on word identification. The adequacy of these claims has not been evaluated, that is, it is not known if the assumptions that have been made to account for the effects of lexical ambiguity resolution on eye movements are sufficient to explain these effects. This chapter discusses the E-Z Reader model of eye-movement control during reading that is used as a framework to evaluate the theoretical assumptions that have been developed to explain lexical ambiguity resolution. This modeling exercise is informative because it demonstrates that not all accounts of lexical ambiguity are equally viable, and because it suggests further constraints on the types of cognitive processes that drive eye movements during reading.},

The first method works by tricking the eye tracker to detect an abrupt change in the gaze position of an artificial eye that in actuality does not move. Such a device, referred to as an artificial saccade generator, is shown to be extremely useful for measuring the temporal accuracy and precision of eye tracking systems and for validating the latency to display change in gaze contingent display paradigms. The second method involves an artificial pupil that is mounted on a computer controlled moving platform. This device is designed to be able to provide the eye tracker with motion sequences that closely resemble biological eye movements. The main advantage of using artificial motion for testing eye tracking data quality is the fact that the spatiotemporal signal is fully specified in a manner independent of the eye tracker that is being evaluated and that nearly identical motion sequence can be reproduced multiple times with great precision. The results of the present study demonstrate that the equipment described has the potential to become an important tool in the comprehensive evaluation of data quality.},

In 2 experiments, participants read sentence words (shown in blue color) while ignoring interleaved distractor strings (shown in orange color). Each single-line text display contained a target word and a critical distractor. Critical distractors were located just prior to the target in the text and were either words or symbol strings (e.g., @\#\%\&). Target word availability for parafoveal processing (i.e., preview validity) was also manipulated. The results indicated much shallower processing of distractors than targets, and this pattern was more pronounced for symbol than word distractors. The influences of word frequency and fixation location on first-pass fixation durations on distractors were dramatically different than the well-documented pattern obtained in normal reading. Robust preview benefits were demonstrated both when the critical distractors were fixated and when the critical distractors were skipped. Finally, with the exception of larger preview benefits that were obtained in the condition in which the target and critical distractor were identical, the magnitude of the preview effect was largely unaffected by the nature of the critical distractor. Implications of the present paradigm and findings to the study of eye-movement control in reading are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

We present a unified framework of methods for the extraction of features that describe the temporal, positional and dynamic characteristics of eye movements. We perform statistical analysis of feature values by employing eye movement data from a normative population of 298 subjects, recorded during a text reading task. We present overall measures for the central tendency and variability of feature values, and we quantify the test-retest reliability of features using either the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (for normally distributed and normalized features) or Kendall's coefficient of concordance (for non-normally distributed features). Finally, for the case of normally distributed and normalized features we additionally perform factor analysis and provide interpretations of the resulting factors. The presented methods and analysis can provide a valuable tool for researchers in various fields that explore eye movements, such as in behavioral studies, attention and cognition research, medical research, biometric recognition, and human-computer interaction.},

How can we make claims about texts, when we cannot read every text or analyze every piece of data produced? This article draws on rhetorical and literary theories of textual interpretation to develop a hermeneutical theory for gaining insight about texts with large amounts of computational data. It proposes that computational data about texts can be thought of as analytical lenses that make certain textual features salient. Analysts can read texts with these lenses, and argue for interpretations by arguing for how the analyses of many pieces of data support a particular understanding of text(s). By focusing on validating an understanding of the corpus rather than explaining every piece of data, we allow space for close reading by the human reader, focus our contributions on the humanistic insight we can gain from our corpora, and make it possible to glean insight in a way that is feasible for the limited human reader while still having strategies to argue for (or against) certain interpretations. This theory is demonstrated with an analysis of academic writing using stylometry methods, by offering a view of knowledge-making processes in the disciplines through a close analysis of function words.},

  abstract = {Using gaze-contingent display changes in the boundary paradigm during sentence reading, it has recently been shown that parafoveal word-processing difficulties affect fixations on words to the right of the boundary. Current interpretations of this post-boundary preview difficulty effect range from delayed parafoveal-on-foveal effects in parallel word-processing models to forced fixations in serial word-processing models. However, these findings are based on an experimental design that, while allowing to isolate preview difficulty effects, might have established a bias with respect to asymmetries in parafoveal preview benefit for high-frequent and low-frequent target words. Here, we present a revision of this paradigm varying the preview?s lexical frequency and keeping the target word constant. We found substantial effects of the preview difficulty in fixation durations after the boundary confirming that preview processing affects the oculomotor decisions not only via trans-saccadic integration of preview and target word information. An additional time-course analysis showed that the preview difficulty effect was significant across the full fixation duration distribution on the target word without any evidence on the pretarget word before the boundary. We discuss implications of the accumulating evidence of post-boundary preview difficulty effects for models of eye movement control during reading.}

  abstract = {An introduction to text analysis using computer-assisted interpretive practices, accompanied by example essays that illustrate the use of these computational tools. The image of the scholar as a solitary thinker dates back at least to Descartes' Discourse on Method. But scholarly practices in the humanities are changing as older forms of communal inquiry are combined with modern research methods enabled by the Internet, accessible computing, data availability, and new media. Hermeneutica introduces text analysis using computer-assisted interpretive practices. It offers theoretical chapters about text analysis, presents a set of analytical tools (called Voyant) that instantiate the theory, and provides example essays that illustrate the use of these tools. Voyant allows users to integrate interpretation into texts by creating hermeneutica---small embeddable ``toys'' that can be woven into essays published online or into such online writing environments as blogs or wikis. The book's companion website, Hermeneuti.ca, offers the example essays with both text and embedded interactive panels. The panels show results and allow readers to experiment with the toys themselves. The use of these analytical tools results in a hybrid essay: an interpretive work embedded with hermeneutical toys that can be explored for technique. The hermeneutica draw on and develop such common interactive analytics as word clouds and complex data journalism interactives. Embedded in scholarly texts, they create a more engaging argument. Moving between tool and text becomes another thread in a dynamic dialogue},

The brothers have individual styles: Wilhelm has a more friendly and personal tone independent on addresses, while Jacob has a more impersonal style, unless he was writing to Wilhelm.

To that end, this chapter zooms in on (1) the competition between stylistic 						context and regional community regarding dative choice, (2) cross-regional inter-register variation, and (3) register-specific 						coherence (aka intra-register variation). Comparing data from nine varieties of English using corpora that presumably share 						the same structure (and registers) reveals that community is more important than context, that the effect of register is 						regionally variable and that registers are largely but not fully coherent. These findings do not only stress the variable 						nature of probabilistic grammars but also point to the importance of regional effects when studying register variation (all 						scripts at               https://osf.io/3djkr/               ).},

Therefore the unprecedented circumstances that have extended the scope of scholarly review for this chapter beyond a single chronological year also provide the unique opportunity to not only `trace and expand upon currents in critical and cultural theory, and to engage in [the] areas' key debates' (Quinn and Ghosh, `Preface' to YWCCT 2022) but also (and more importantly, one might argue) understand some of the radical thematic transformations brought about and anticipated by the legacies, presents, and futures of digital humanities within the supposedly `new normal' of a post-Covid world.             Through consolidating diverse conversations from varied contexts that are shaping contemporary digital humanities and in anticipating the futures of the discipline, this chapter locates scholarship in the digital humanities and related fields from the years 2021 and 2022 within the interconnected themes of resistive ontologies, organizations, and new directions in the digital humanities. While the focus remains on the scholarship produced within the aforesaid chronological period, our methodological attempt in this intervention has been to acknowledge and put into dialogue relevant contributions related to the three primary themes of analysis that may fall beyond the ambit of a specific period.},

This article applies Cognitive Grammar to the analysis of a character?s mind that is represented with Free Indirect Style. In the tradition of mind style analysis, it aims to use linguistics to reveal some of the underlying cognitive processes and proclivities at work in the character?s psychology. The character in question is the protagonist in Malcolm Lowry?s Under the Volcano, an alcoholic who is largely characterised by his drunken behaviour and ideation. This article therefore focuses on the linguistic features that serve to represent his inebriated state of mind. It analyses the semantic effects of those features primarily in terms of attentional focus, drawing on Cognitive Grammar concepts, such as objective construal, specificity, scope, profile and domain, and relating these to the protagonist?s cognitive proclivities for solipsism, partial awareness, delayed reaction, attenuated experience and self-delusion. The article also discusses the theoretical background for mind style analysis, arguing for the continued importance of focusing on the relationship between the text and a character?s mind, alongside the focus on the reader?s mind that has come to dominate cognitive stylistics.}

In a library one-shot, teaching the library discovery system or showing how to perform an advanced search in a database would be buttonology. Knowing how to upload texts into a tool like Voyant does not help researchers think about what texts should be uploaded, how selecting data relates to a research question, or even what constitutes an effective research question. This type of teaching does not encourage critical thinking, yet digital humanities instruction, in our experience, is frequently focused on showing how to use software rather than reflect on the broader context.}

But despite a widespread interest for what narrative means for the life of the mind, the significance of the concrete contributions of the so-called cognitive sciences to narratology is far from enjoying broad acknowledgment. In this paper I propose a critical examination of the various approaches to narrative that can be called \&\#x201c;cognitive,\&\#x201d; from hard scientific studies based on brain scanning, to psychological experiments that test the reaction of subjects to simple texts composed specially for the occasion, to the import of concepts from the more speculative disciplines of the cognitive sciences, such as social psychology or philosophy of mind. I distinguish three areas of investigation for cognitive narratology: (1) the minds of characters; (2) the mental activity of the reader (spectator, player, etc); (3) narrative as a way of thinking. Against the tendency to conceive cognitive narratology as a matter of borrowing ready-made concepts from the cognitive sciences and applying them top-down to texts, I argue in favor of trusting the ability of our own minds to figure out how the mind creates, decodes and uses stories.}

The approach is not intended as a general theory of narrative, but rather as a particular generative mechanism relevant to several academic communities: (1) literary critics and narrative theorists interested in new models for narrative analysis, (2) artificial intelligence researchers and video game designers interested in new mechanisms for narrative generation, and (3) complex systems theorists interested in novel applications of agent-based modeling and network theory. The paper is divided into two parts. The first part offers examples of research by literary critics on the relationship between social networks of fictional characters and the structure of long-form narratives, particularly novels. The second part provides an example of schematic story generation based on a simulation of the structural balance network model. I will argue that if literary critics can better understand sophisticated narratives by extracting networks from them, then narrative intelligence researchers can benefit by inverting the process, that is, by generating narratives from networks.},

Indeed, despite the availability of other forms of communication, text is still one of the most common ways of communication in a social network. The target of the work described in this paper is to detect and analyze sentiment and emotion expressed by people from text in their twitter posts and use them for generating recommendations. We collected tweets and replies on few specific topics and created a dataset with text, user, emotion, sentiment information, etc. We used the dataset to detect sentiment and emotion from tweets and their replies and measured the influence scores of users based on various user-based and tweet-based parameters. Finally, we used the latter information to generate generalized and personalized recommendations for users based on their twitter activity. The method we used in this paper includes some interesting novelties such as, (i) including replies to tweets in the dataset and measurements, (ii) introducing agreement score, sentiment score and emotion score of replies in influence score calculation, (iii) generating general and personalized recommendation containing list of users who agreed on the same topic and expressed similar emotions and sentiments towards that particular topic.},

Our vastly improved account of relief-type figurative geoglyphs reveals that they differ from line-type figurative geoglyphs beyond their style and size. The line type and relief type also differ in the motifs they depict, their distribution, and their relation to the meshwork of winding trails and the ceremonial network of linear/trapezoidal geoglyphs. Taken together, this makes a compelling case for different nature and purposes of relief-type and line-type figurative geoglyphs: the former sharing information about human activities with individuals or small groups and the latter built and used by the community for ceremonial purposes. It took nearly a century to discover a total of 430 figurative Nazca geoglyphs, which offer significant insights into the ancient cultures at the Nazca Pampa. Here, we report the deployment of an AI system to the entire Nazca region, a UNESCO World Heritage site, leading to the discovery of 303 new figurative geoglyphs within only 6 mo of field survey, nearly doubling the number of known figurative geoglyphs. Even with limited training examples, the developed AI approach is demonstrated to be effective in detecting the smaller relief-type geoglyphs, which unlike the giant line-type geoglyphs are very difficult to discern. The improved account of figurative geoglyphs enables us to analyze their motifs and distribution across the Nazca Pampa. We find that relief-type geoglyphs depict mainly human motifs or motifs of things modified by humans, such as domesticated animals and decapitated heads (81.6\%). They are typically located within viewing distance (on average 43 m) of ancient trails that crisscross the Nazca Pampa and were most likely built and viewed at the individual or small-group level. On the other hand, the giant line-type figurative geoglyphs mainly depict wild animals (64\%). They are found an average of 34 m from the elaborate linear/trapezoidal network of geoglyphs, which suggests that they were probably built and used on a community level for ritual activities.}

In some extraordinary situations, such as natural disasters, war, massacres, terrorism, or mass migration, the traumatic event is shared by a community and the effects go beyond those directly affected. Today, thanks to recorded interviews and testimonials, many archives and collections exist that are open to researchers of trauma studies, holocaust studies, and historians, among others. These archives act as vital testimonials for oral history, politics, and human rights. As such, they are usually either transcribed or meticulously indexed. In this work, we propose to look at the nonverbal signals emitted by victims of various traumatic events when they describe the trauma and we seek to render these for novel representations without taking into account the explicit verbal content. Our preliminary paralinguistic analysis on a manually annotated collection of testimonials from different archives, as well as on a corpus prepared for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder detection indicates a tentative connection between breathing and emotional states of speakers, which opens up new possibilities of exploring oral history archives.},

However, the experiments had relatively small sample sizes and hence low statistical power. To address this limitation, the present authors conducted four high-powered replication experiments (combined N = 1006) testing the causal impact of reading literary fiction on mentalising. Relative to the original research, the present experiments used the same literary texts in the reading manipulation; the same mentalising task; and the same kind of participant samples. Moreover, one experiment was pre-registered as a direct replication. In none of the experiments did reading literary fiction have any effect on mentalising relative to control conditions. The results replicate earlier findings that familiarity with fiction is positively correlated with mentalising. Taken together, the present findings call into question whether a single session of reading fiction leads to immediate improvements in mentalising.}

  abstract = {Storytelling can be considered good professional practice for organizational communication as it resonates with stakeholder audiences and contributes to the process of sensemaking. This paper challenges two key assumptions that underpin storytelling in an organizational context. The first assumption is that clarity is the goal of storytelling and therefore linear modes of organizational storytelling should be used to reduce complexity to achieve clarity of understanding of organizational messages. The second assumption is that organizational storytelling consists only of the stories an organization tells about itself, and multiple understandings or `mixed messages' are `noise'. This paper will argue that the storytelling concept antenarrative -- or narrative fragments that can form emergent storytelling episodes -- will expand the parameters of sensemaking in organizational storytelling. Furthermore, listening to emergent storytelling episodes can provide insights into prospective sensemaking, which has implications for organizational storytelling practices in our digital age. Putting antenarrative alongside concepts such as `listening' and `engagement' helps to improve organizational storytelling to work toward more effective organizational communication practice and respond to the challenges of complexity in storytelling, entanglements of the porous organization, and digital disruption.},

We tested the hypothesis that such information is processed with respect to the main character in a narrative rather than with respect to a secondary character. In Experiment 1, subjects making attributions of awareness of such background states were more likely to attribute such awareness to main than to secondary characters. In Experiment 2, using self-paced reading, we showed that such information is more important for main than for secondary characters during reading. Thus, unattached background information is processed with respect to main characters. This bias provides a source of control over the processing necessary to establish a coherent representation during the reading of narratives. Experiment 3 eliminated the possibility that the effects were due to generally shallower processing of sentences centered on secondary characters.},

We also show how linguistic properties of focus, subordination and focalization can control depth of processing, leading to underspecified representations. Modulation of degrees of specification might provide a way forward in the development of models of the processing underlying language understanding.},

  abstract = {As Transfer Learning from large-scale pre-trained models becomes more prevalent in Natural Language Processing (NLP), operating these large models in on-the-edge and/or under constrained computational training or inference budgets remains challenging. In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a smaller general-purpose language representation model, called DistilBERT, which can then be fine-tuned with good performances on a wide range of tasks like its larger counterparts. While most prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-specific models, we leverage knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase and show that it is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by 40\%, while retaining 97\% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60\% faster. To leverage the inductive biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple loss combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our smaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its capabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a comparative on-device study.},

As stylometric findings should be based on a comparative basis, a corpus of tweets written by Obama during his presidency, and those posted by the White House account during the same period are employed to reveal Trump's specific stylistic idiosyncrasies. In addition, the most characteristic words and tweet features are analyzed, indicating that Trump mainly refers to himself or to close relatives. This study points out that President Trump is always driving an electoral campaign, refers positively to a single news source, but generally I-words are not overused. Even if inappropriate words occur from time to time, their frequency level is lower than typical male Twitter users. Finally, Trump's rhetoric can be characterized by a definite and negative tone without many references to people. His judgments are definitive and emphasized with grandiose adjectives.},

Published just month's after his passing, the text was as beholden to Cicero's De Senectute (Concerning Old Age), as it was to Grass's long-term autobiographical project, a trilogy of works defining his often controversial legacy. In that sense, Vonne Endlichkait is a coda to the preceding biographies. Internal evidence indicates that Grass, the writer and graphic artist, had been working on the text for some time. He departed from his narrative norm of the previous works, by framing his ruminations as a sequence of poems and short prose chapters (some 96 in all). Overall the beautifully printed book is shot through with his illustrations, graphic prints depicting everything from dead birds and drifting feathers to severed fingers and a gruesome self-portrait. The idiosyncratic iconography, as incomprehensible as it may seem to be, is shown to be related to images predating Vonne Endlichkait by decades, while also introducing new icons. Above all, the creative cross references between word and image define the 87-year-old author as an agile intellect to the last.]}

Open Science principles, if taken seriously, determine the priorities in tool development and usage in a way that makes, e.g., inclusivity, openness and fairness an imperative. This change of focus in tool development has a profound impact on digital practices. Digital Practices in the humanities by far exceed what we now call Digital Humanities, but, as this article aims to show, the discourses and questions prevalent in Digital Humanities can be of aid when addressing the questions the humanities have to solve in reflecting on and understanding the change of research practices through digitalization. The research landscape of Digital Humanities and the humanities differs in some decisive points due to different focal points and challenges that have to be faced. The frictions this causes can be made productive by initiating meta-reflections on the shape of the humanities to come.},

Recent studies showed that users tend to select information that is consistent with their system of beliefs, forming polarized groups of like-minded people around shared narratives where dissenting information is ignored. In this environment, users cooperate to frame and reinforce their shared narrative making any attempt at debunking inefficient. Such a configuration occurs even in the consumption of news online, and considering that 63\% of users access news directly form social media, one hypothesis is that more polarization allows for further spreading of misinformation. Along this path, we focus on the polarization of users around news outlets on Facebook in different European countries (Italy, France, Spain and Germany). First, we compare the pages' posting behavior and the users' interacting patterns across countries and observe different posting, liking and commenting rates. Second, we explore the tendency of users to interact with different pages (i.e., selective exposure) and the emergence of polarized communities generated around specific pages. Then, we introduce a new metric -- i.e., polarization rank -- to measure polarization of communities for each country. We find that Italy is the most polarized country, followed by France, Germany and lastly Spain. Finally, we present a variation of the Bounded Confidence Model to simulate the emergence of these communities by considering the users' engagement and trust on the news. Our findings suggest that trust in information broadcaster plays a pivotal role against polarization of users online.},

  abstract = {It is well-known that word frequency and predictability affect processing time. These effects change magnitude across tasks, but studies testing this use tasks with different response types (e.g., lexical decision, naming, and fixation time during reading; Schilling, Rayner, \& Chumbley, 1998), preventing direct comparison. Recently, Kaakinen and Hy??n?? (2010) overcame this problem, comparing fixation times in reading for comprehension and proofreading, showing that the frequency effect was larger in proofreading than in reading. This result could be explained by readers exhibiting substantial cognitive flexibility, and qualitatively changing how they process words in the proofreading task in a way that magnifies effects of word frequency. Alternatively, readers may not change word processing so dramatically, and instead may perform more careful identification generally, increasing the magnitude of many word processing effects (e.g., both frequency and predictability). We tested these possibilities with two experiments: subjects read for comprehension and then proofread for spelling errors (letter transpositions) that produce nonwords (e.g., trcak for track as in Kaakinen \& Hy??n??) or that produce real but unintended words (e.g., trial for trail) to compare how the task changes these effects. Replicating Kaakinen and Hy??n??, frequency effects increased during proofreading. However, predictability effects only increased when integration with the sentence context was necessary to detect errors (i.e., when spelling errors produced words that were inappropriate in the sentence; trial for trail). The results suggest that readers adopt sophisticated word processing strategies to accommodate task demands. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

It includes linguistic norms on the lexical, super-lexical, and sub-lexical level. Such norms are urgently needed in psychological research for the design of age-adequate stimulus and training materials. Separate norms are available for three age groups: 6 -- 8 years (1st and 2nd grade), 9 -- 10 years (3rd and 4th grade), and 11 -- 12 years (5th and 6th grade). Moreover, childLex is directly comparable to the DWDS corpus, a large corpus for adults' print language. Here, we describe how childLex was collected and analyzed and compare frequency norms on the lexical, super-lexical, and sub-lexical level with frequency norms obtained from the DWDS corpus. Results show moderate levels of correspondence in the highfrequency range and on the sub-lexical level, but strong discrepancies for medium- and low-frequency elements on the lexical and superlexical level. Finally, we illustrate which variables are available in childLex and how they can be retrieved using a web interface.},

Monitoring readers' eye movements provides a fine-grained online protocol of the reading process as it evolves over time, but until recently eye movements have rarely been collected for young developing and ageing people. Developmental eye-tracking constitutes an emerging and innovative field that addresses various theoretical questions related to changes in the process of reading across the lifespan and the mechanisms that drive intra-individual trajectories and create inter-individual differences among readers. The aim of this editorial is to briefly summarise the current state of the field and to outline which questions are currently being investigated and presented in this Special Issue.}

Their effects are well-documented in eye movement studies, but pertinent evidence from neuroimaging primarily stem from single-word presentations. We investigated the effects of these variables during reading of whole sentences with simultaneous eye-tracking and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fixation-related fMRI). Increasing word length was associated with increasing activation in occipital areas linked to visual analysis. Additionally, length elicited a U-shaped modulation (i.e., least activation for medium-length words) within a brain stem region presumably linked to eye movement control. These effects, however, were diminished when accounting for multiple fixation cases. Increasing frequency was associated with decreasing activation within left inferior frontal, superior parietal, and occipito-temporal regions. The function of the latter region - hosting the putative visual word form area - was originally considered as limited to sublexical processing. An exploratory analysis revealed that increasing predictability was associated with decreasing activation within middle temporal and inferior frontal regions previously implicated in memory access and unification. The findings are discussed with regard to their correspondence with findings from single-word presentations and with regard to neurocognitive models of visual word recognition, semantic processing, and eye movement control during reading.}

  abstract = {This research takes as its starting point the past decade of critiques from human geographers, and proposes an alternate model for appraisals of technology. The first section begins with an analysis of the bases and motivation of external assessments of GIS. A historiographical account reveals that the critical impulse among human geographers was not static, but evolved to incorporate greater subtlety based on cooperation with GIS scholars. Critiques from human geographers, nevertheless, had a profound impact on the discipline, and practitioners of GIS frequently felt that their perspectives on issues including the roots of GIS, its epistemological bases, and its ethics had been undervalued by critics. A re-analysis of critiques, from the perspectives of GIS practitioners, investigates objections to critical accounts of the technology. The second half of the research builds upon existing critiques and responses to them, but asks the question, "is there a more constructive means to engage with technology, from a theoretical perspective?" Two contemporary research questions in GIS are investigated, as a means of establishing a preliminary methodology for critique that engages with GIS at a conceptual, as well as a technical level. Factors that have influenced the progress of automated generalization are examined in some detail. The argument is made that both social and digital parameters define the technology, and it is unproductive to focus on one at the expense of the other. The second research question concerns data models and the extent to which fields and objects are inevitable. The case is made that a web of historical and scientific justification has prevented researchers from seeking alternatives to the atomic and plenum views of space. Finally, an appeal is made for continued theoretical examination of the technology as part of an effort to develop geographic information science.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        This work introduces EmoAtlas as a computational framework extracting emotions and syntactic/semantic word associations automatically from texts. EmoAtlas implements a cutting-edge synergy of interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) and psychologically-validated lexicons. Our framework supports out-of-the-box emotion detection of 8 categorical emotions and syntactic network building in 18 languages. In the task of detecting emotions in human-labelled social media posts and news media articles, either in Italian or in English, EmoAtlas achieves performances analogous, or even superior (e.g., 70.2\% precision for detecting joy in tweets), to state-of-art natural language processing techniques like BERT, RoBERTa, distillBERT and ALBERT (e.g., 67.9\% precision for detecting joy in tweets). This performance comes with EmoAtlas being 12 times faster than BERT. In a psychometric task like reproducing human creativity ratings for 1,071 short stories, EmoAtlas and BERT obtain equivalent predictive power ({$\rho$} {$\approx$}0.495, p{$<$}10             -4             ). Combining BERT's semantic features with EmoAtlas' emotional/syntactic networks of words, the cross-validated resulting AIs get substantially better at estimating creativity rates of stories ({$\rho$} {$\approx$}0.628, p{$<$}10             -4             ). This indicates an interplay between the creativity of narratives and the semantic, emotional, and syntactic divergence of their words, pointing out how EmoAtlas and BERT-like models could be used in synergy in psychometrics. By outputting interpretable emotional profiles and syntactic networks, EmoAtlas can quantify how emotions are channelled through specific associations in texts, e.g., how did customers frame their ideas and emotions towards "beds" in hotel reviews? We release EmoAtlas as a standalone computational tool and discuss its impact in modelling texts as data, promisingly filling current research gaps in AI and cognitive science.}

Previous research has generally demonstrated additive effects of predictability and frequency in fixation times. Studies examining the role of parafoveal preview have shown that greater preview benefit is obtained from more predictable and higher frequency words versus less predictable and lower frequency words. In two experiments, we investigated effects of target word predictability, frequency, and parafoveal preview. A 3 (Predictability: low, medium, high) {\texttimes} 2 (Frequency: low, high) design was used with Preview (valid, invalid) manipulated between experiments. With valid previews, we found main effects of Predictability and Frequency in both fixation time and probability measures, including an interaction in early fixation measures. With invalid preview, we again found main effects of Predictability and Frequency in fixation times, but no evidence of an interaction. Fixation probability showed a weak Predictability effect and Predictability-Frequency interaction. Predictability interacted with Preview in early fixation time and probability measures. Our findings suggest that high levels of contextual constraint exert an early influence during lexical processing in reading. Results are discussed in terms of models of language processing and eye movement control.},

Sentiment analysis prediction is an innovative technique to analyze the emotions of the people with their suggestions uploaded in their personal media. One novel idea is a research study of the behavioral attributes of individuals in social networks. Such type of characteristics may be found on other social networking websites viz Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Flickers etc. So the social networking site is the best way to find actions of people, thought style, mood, selfish networks, and opinions etc. Here, we are dealing with machine learning algorithms to predict users' online social activity which provides an opportunity to actively identify the positive and negative emotion rates. The experimental evaluation shows positive and negative emotion rate for both proposed and existing algorithms DAN, DAN2, SVM and SVM-of. The proposed system gives better results with 95.9\% accuracy. The experimental investigation can be found that machine learning algorithms are a good choice for predicting public sentiments using twitter data.},

To understand this phenomenon, we tracked a comprehensive collection of political rumors on Twitter during the 2012 US presidential election campaign, analyzing a large set of rumor tweets (n\,=\,330,538). We found that Twitter helped rumor spreaders circulate false information within homophilous follower networks, but seldom functioned as a self-correcting marketplace of ideas. Rumor spreaders formed strong partisan structures in which core groups of users selectively transmitted negative rumors about opposing candidates. Yet, rumor rejecters neither formed a sizable community nor exhibited a partisan structure. While in general rumors resisted debunking by professional fact-checking sites (e.g. Snopes), this was less true of rumors originating with satirical sources.}

  abstract = {Language comprehension involves analysis at the level of the word, sentence, and message and the integration of message meaning with the prior discourse and world knowledge. Contemporary research converges on another facet of comprehension: the validation of message consistency. Existing evidence already favors several principles in validation of reading and listening. Validation is initiated immediately and is routine rather than requiring intentional strategies. Successful validation is a precondition to updating the situational representation of the message. Validation applies to discourse inferences as well as explicit assertions. Finally, the memory-retrieval processes that enable validation closely resemble those of intentional discourse memory. Competing observations of people's validation failures are proposed to systematically stem from features of the message, understander, and comprehension task. Therefore, theoretical analysis that accommodates both successful and deficient language validation ought to be attainable.}

The experimental work involves transforming the collected blog data into vector space representation, doing Parts of Speech Tagging to extract opinionated words and then applying semantic orientation approach based SO-PMI-IR algorithm for mining the sentiment and mood information contained in the blog text. We obtained interesting results, which have been successfully evaluated for correctness through both manual tagging and by cross-validating the outcomes with other machine learning techniques. The results demonstrate that these analytical schemes can be successfully used for blog post analysis in addition to the review texts. The paper concludes with a short discussion of relevance of the work and its applied perspective.},

In addition, in order to demonstrate how the CADS approach can provide a better understanding of humorous and ironic discourse, a corpus of humorous satirical newspaper headlines is analyzed for grammatical constructions associated with evaluative reaction verbs. According to the prevailing linguistic and cognitive theories of humor, the concept of incongruity applies to at least two separate yet related aspects of humor: The physical structure of humor as well as the cognitive process that unfolds during humor comprehension. In line with previous CADS analyses, which suggest that verbal irony involves a reversal of evaluation, several initial keyword in context (KWIC) searches were conducted in the current data.},

  abstract = {Readers eyes often skip over words as they read. Skipping rates are largely determined by word length; short words are skipped more than long words. However, the predictability of a word in context also impacts skipping rates. Rayner, Slattery, Drieghe and Liversedge (2011) reported an effect of predictability on word skipping for even long words (10-13 characters) that extend beyond the word identification span. Recent research suggests that better readers and spellers have an enhanced perceptual span (Veldre \& Andrews, 2014). We explored whether reading and spelling skill interact with word length and predictability to impact word skipping rates in a large sample (N=92) of average and poor adult readers. Participants read the items from Rayner et al. (2011) while their eye movements were recorded. Spelling skill (zSpell) was assessed using the dictation and recognition tasks developed by Sally Andrews and colleagues. Reading skill (zRead) was assessed from reading speed (words per minute) and accuracy of three 120 word passages each with 10 comprehension questions. We fit linear mixed models to the target gaze duration data and generalized linear mixed models to the target word skipping data. Target word gaze durations were significantly predicted by zRead while, the skipping likelihoods were significantly predicted by zSpell. Additionally, for gaze durations, zRead significantly interacted with word predictability as better readers relied less on context to support word processing. These effects are discussed in relation to the lexical quality hypothesis and eye movement models of reading.}

This paper analyzes whether the sentiment expressed in Twitter feeds, which discuss selected companies and their products, can indicate their stock price changes. To address this problem, an active learning approach was developed and applied to sentiment analysis of tweet streams in the stock market domain. The paper first presents a static Twitter data analysis problem, explored in order to determine the best Twitter-specific text preprocessing setting for training the Support Vector Machine (SVM) sentiment classifier. In the static setting, the Granger causality test shows that sentiments in stock-related tweets can be used as indicators of stock price movements a few days in advance, where improved results were achieved by adapting the SVM classifier to categorize Twitter posts into three sentiment categories of positive, negative and neutral (instead of positive and negative only). These findings were adopted in the development of a new stream-based active learning approach to sentiment analysis, applicable in incremental learning from continuously changing financial tweet streams. To this end, a series of experiments was conducted to determine the best querying strategy for active learning of the SVM classifier adapted to sentiment analysis of financial tweet streams. The experiments in analyzing stock market sentiments of a particular company show that changes in positive sentiment probability can be used as indicators of the changes in stock closing prices.},

The distinction between evolutionary-universal and other ``secondary'' emotions is empirically uninformative for all five cultures. Next, the emotion-wheel theory of Plutchik receives no empirical support. All palette theories fail four empirical tests. More than 90 empirical tests fail to support Kemper and Turner in assuming that many secondary emotions arise through complex combinations of primary emotions due to socialization. The Johnson-Laird and Oatley hypothesis of five universal clusters of emotions is also tested and rejected. Researchers need to rethink the heuristic value of dichotomizing and lumping emotions in categories such as universal, primary, basic, secondary, tertiary, and so forth. There are clear empirical advantages to differentiating between emotions with three dimensions rather than two dimensions.}

We evaluated the influence of average concreteness, valence (positivity) and arousal of the contexts in which a word occurs on response times in the lexical decision task, age of acquisition of the word, and word recognition memory performance. Using large corpora and norming mega-studies we quantified semantics of contexts for thousands of words and demonstrated that contextual factors were predictive of lexical representation and processing above and beyond the influence shown by concreteness, valence and arousal of the word itself. Our findings indicate that lexical representations are influenced not only by how diverse the word's contexts are, but also by the embodied experiences they elicit.},

Joyce worked these drafts into the manuscript that is now known as the `V.A.3-Buffalo' manuscript, in its turn the antecedent of the fair copy forming part of the so-called Rosenbach manuscript on which the published Gabler edition of Ulysses is based. In the study presented in this article, I chose three passages from the earliest drafts and found their corresponding passages in the V.A.3-Buffalo manuscript, and the published text (amounting to a total of nine text passages). In both manuscripts the first layer (before revisions) was chosen, to have the greatest possible difference between versions. After dividing the texts into roughly sentence-length segments, I conducted a foregrounding analysis on all segments of the nine texts and quantified the foregrounding devices. The objective of the presented study was to investigate whether results of past empirical studies of foregrounding, which have concentrated on poems or fairly straightforward narratives would hold true for such complex texts as James Joyce's Ulysses. To measure reader responses to the foregrounding of the texts, ratings on strikingness and affect, as well as reading times per segment were recorded. These responses proved to correlate significantly with the numerical foregrounding index per segment. Additionally, a salient framework is proposed for the study of manuscript materials.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            This article explores hitherto unexplored complexities in the positioning of the Modernist narrator. Taking as a starting point Banfield's `empty centre' technique, the article re-evaluates the difficulties posed by this phenomenon and develops a more thorough and a sounder understanding of `the empty centre'. Some of the evidence for a new theory of `empty centre' passages comes from pragmatics and naturally occurring discourse data. In particular, an investigation of the impersonal uses of generic pronouns, which Monika Fludernik (1993.               The fictions of language and the languages of fiction: The linguistic representation of speech and consciousness               . London: Routledge; 1996.               Towards a natural narratology               . London: Routledge) had established as key to our understanding of the technique, sheds new light on the nature of the `empty centre' technique and leads to a new understanding of the status of the Modernist narrator. I propose that it is most plausible that the reader will naturalise examples of `the empty centre' as stemming from the narrator. I also argue that we need to construct a new understanding of the status of the Modernist narrator which takes into account some of the central tenets of the Modernist aesthetic, those concerning subjectivity and the possibility of objectivity. Thus, what emerges from the analysis is that the self, and the narratorial figure by extension, can no longer be endowed with the power of omniscience. I will develop my theoretical explanation of `the empty centre' and the positioning of the narrator in Modernist fiction with reference to a variety of examples, mainly drawn from Katherine Mansfield and Virginia Woolf.},

  abstract = {This chapter explores the holistic nature of subjective character experience in Modernist fiction and how this is represented stylistically, including all aspects of sensory experience and all levels of consciousness. I argue that the report of action, typically assigned to the narrator as external observer and reporter (Toolan, Narrative: A Critical Linguistic Introduction, London, Routledge, 2001), acquires a subjective dimension that can position it as part of Free Indirect Style, the style reserved for the representation of consciousness. Physical experience is inextricably interwoven with thought, feeling and sensory perception in Modernist texts, thus ceasing to be reported as if from an outside narrator and instead appearing as if it is a mimetic representation of an aspect of the character's consciousness, a kinetic sense. While the majority of scholars treat Free Indirect Style as discourse (Fludernik, The Fictions of Language and the Languages of Fiction, London, Routledge, 1993; Leech and Short, Style in Fiction, London, Routledge, 2007), the Modernist examples challenge the dichotomy between objective external report and subjective inner speech by weaving together all aspects of experience into a subjective representation. Such an analysis might lead to a new category of consciousness representation---the experience of action---and is in line with concurrent developments in phenomenology. In the chapter, I offer an overview of theories of Free Indirect Style and speech and thought representation and argue that the representation of consciousness cannot be reduced to the representation of verbal thought, the analysis of which has been based on the categories used for speech representation. I analyse examples from a range of Modernist texts, paying particular attention to the syntactic fusing of different modes of consciousness representation, which through their syntactic intersection with the representation of action portray it as part of the character's subjective experience.},

  abstract = {English Recent years have seen a growing focus on diversity in the digital humanities, and yet there has been rather less work on geolinguistic diversity, and the research which has been carried out often focuses on the structures of geographic representation in the field or has viewed `language' as a technical or linguistic problem to solve. This article takes a different view, namely that we need to consider this diversity through multiple `frames' of digitally-mediated language and culture, and that this is not just a question of epistemic justice or community manners, but that the digital humanities also need to address more actively challenges around global dynamics of digital multilingualism, transcultural exchange and geodiversity in its research agenda. This paper explores these questions through the prism of `language indifference' in digital studies and, responding to Galina's call for better data on the state of geolinguistic diversity in DH (2014), it articulates possible frameworks for addressing this diversity in a strategic, programmatic and research-led manner. We conclude by exploring the role of a greater multilingual focus in what Liu calls `the techne of diversity' in digital humanities (2020), and contend that the digital humanities has much to gain, and much to offer, in engaging more fully with the languages-related cultural challenges of our era.\&nbsp;R{\'e}sum{\'e}Ces derni{\`e}res ann{\'e}es l'accent a {\'e}t{\'e} mis de plus en plus sur la diversit{\'e} dans les sciences humaines num{\'e}riques, et pourtant il y a plut{\^o}t eu moins de travaux sur la diversit{\'e} geo linguistique, et les recherches qui ont {\'e}t{\'e} men{\'e}es portent souvent sur les structures de la repr{\'e}sentation g{\'e}ographique sur le terrain, ou estiment le `langage' comme un probl{\`e}me technique ou linguistique {\`a} r{\'e}soudre.

  abstract = {Abstract Museums, archives, libraries and other cultural heritage institutes maintain large collections of artefacts, which are valuable knowledge sources for both experts and interested lay persons. Recently, more and more cultural heritage institutes have started to digitise their collections, for instance to make them accessible via web portals. However, while digitisation is a necessary first step towards improved information access, to fully unlock the knowledge contained in these collections, users have to be able to easily browse, search and query these collections. This requires cleaning, linking and enriching the data, a process that is often too time-consuming to be performed manually. Information technology can help with (partially) automating this task. Because data processing and enrichment typically involve the textual metadata level, natural language processing has a key role to play in this endeavour. At the same time, cultural heritage domains pose significant challenges for language technology and call for the development of very robust and flexible solutions. Consequently, cultural heritage data can also serve as a good test-bed for the development of robust natural language processing tools.}

  abstract = {{\copyright} 2018 American Psychological Association. A word's predictability, as measured by its cloze probability, has a robust influence on the time a reader's eyes spend on the word, with more predictable words receiving shorter fixations. However, several previous studies using the boundary paradigm have found no apparent effect of predictability on early reading time measures when the reader does not have valid parafoveal preview of the target word. The present study directly assesses this pattern in two experiments, demonstrating evidence for a null effect of predictability on first fixation and gaze duration with invalid preview, supported by Bayes factor analyses. While the effect of context independent word frequency is shown to survive with invalid preview, consistent with previous studies, the effect of predictability is eliminated with both unrelated word previews and random letter string previews. These results suggest that a word's predictability influences early stages of orthographic processing, and does so only when perceptual evidence is equivocal, as is the case when the word is initially viewed in parafoveal vision. Word frequency may influence not only early orthographic processing, but also later processing stages.},

Under the headline of `enunciation,' the paper argues that the cognitive linguistics tradition may provide a better understanding of the subjective aspect of language in general and of the narrative aspect of fiction in particular. The paper introduces the contributions of Leonard Talmy and Wallace Chafe. Talmy frames the issues of enunciation within his notion of conceptual structures, while Chafe reinterprets point-of-view as the issue of devices permitting different representations of consciousness in a text. The paper further develops these insights with reference to analyses of a string of fiction examples.

Informed by cognitive linguistics and the psychology of cognition, a strong tradition of cognitive poetics has become established within stylistics, serving as a powerful challenge to the psychological fallacy in particular: readerly effects, emotions and significances in literary engagement are now regarded as part of the legitimate ground of stylistic study. In the classical terms that underpin the long view of stylistics, we now possess a good research programme in the systematic account of meaningfulness (logos) and emotional affect (pathos). What remains is the challenge of a similarly principled account of ethics. However, just as the cognitive turn has taken an applied linguistic approach to interpretation and aesthetics, so our cognitive poetic approach to ethos must be based on a descriptive account not of authority and immanent intentionality, but on the readerly sense of adopting a position in the process of literary reading. The concept of the intentional fallacy cannot be criticised as comprehensively as the psychological fallacy, but it nevertheless poses the wrong sort of question. This article sets out an encompassing framework for the analysis of ethics as an interaction between readerly disposition and textual imposition, to produce a sense of a `positioned reader' of a literary work. Brief analytical illustrations from literary prose fiction are presented for exploration. The article draws on and questions related traditions in critical theory and psychology, with the aim of establishing a fully rounded stylistics as the foundational principle and principal method in literary study. My ultimate framing objective is an applied linguistic approach to literary scholarship that is evidential, dialogic and humane, and which completes the circle of meaning, feeling and significance familiar to generations of literary scholars.},

Corpora which are ordered systematically by temporal dimensions are called ``diachronic corpora''. There is a wide range of historical corpora at the historical linguist's disposal. Since the 1990s, large diachronic corpora, such as the Helsinki Corpus of English Texts (HC), have been made available. The HC ``is still the only truly long-diachrony structured corpus of English texts'' with texts from as early as the eighth century to as late as the eighteenth century. For diachronic analyses of American English, the Corpus of Historical American English is an invaluable resource with over 400 million words covering two centuries.},

Considering the latest events in the world, mass media are becoming a powerful tool for manipulating public consciousness and promoting the interests of one country over another. The article describes the methodology of collecting historical articles from a website, analyzing peak news outbreaks, and analyzing each article's text. The morphological tagging and named-entity recognition as the core of natural language processing was described. A hybrid method based on learning rules and an ensemble of machine learning methods has been developed for sentiment analysis and covert propaganda. The proposed rule-based model allows choosing the class-based lexical approach or on collected dictionaries. The combination of the methods based on dictionaries and rules with the ensemble of machine learning models are developed. The developed stacking model combines weak classifiers and deformed meta-attributes based on the results of pairwise multiplication. Finally, the distorted features are used together with the training dataset in the meta-model. This combination avoids the correlation of the results of weak classifiers and increases the generalizability of the model. The proposed approach demonstrates high accuracy and usage for Russian and Ukrainian languages. The developed method is built on Chambers's proposal. As a result of the analysis, the manipulation of public consciousness and the number of negative articles about the two countries are determined. The results of the check give us reason to consider the information spread by the media to be manipulative.},

Skimming involved longer saccades, shorter average fixation durations, more word skipping, shorter total reading times evenly distributed across the page, and resulted in lower comprehension scores. Spell checking involved shorter saccades, longer average fixation durations, less word skipping, longer total reading times evenly distributed across the entire page, and resulted in lower comprehension scores. Replicating local effects shows that paragraphs maintain sufficient experimental rigor, while also enabling reading analyses from a global perspective.

Historically, the term emerged from the literature on visual word recognition, but more recently is considered to be theoretically non-neutral. The theoretical shift from the view that words are represented as localized lexical entries to one where they are distributed across a number of units has led to the more general term `lexical processing' being preferred in the word recognition literature. Central issues emerging from this literature are described. These include the proposal that the orthographic representation of a word is recoded phonologically in silent reading, that the internal structure of a word plays a role in its processing (including its morphological, syllabic, and subsyllabic structure), and that lexical processing is influenced by the sentential context in which it occurs. Issues specific to spoken word recognition are also raised. Methods used to study lexical processing are described, highlighting the importance of the lexical decision task. In relation to language production, the term `lexical access' is still widely used and is seen to involve two levels: form and function. It is suggested that lexical access in comprehension might be similarly conceived.},

An important finding was that a congruent picture contributed substantially to children's story retellings, more so than a picture that was incongruent with the narration. The eye-tracking data showed that children explored pictures in a way that they could maximally integrate the narration and the picture. Consequences for interactive reading and picture storybook format are discussed.},

What some have called the spatial turn in recent critical theory has highlighted the significance of spatiality in comparative and world literature, among other areas, as the relations between geographical knowledge and cultural productions have been subject to greater scrutiny by scholars in various disciplinary fields. Geocriticism, literary cartography, and the spatial humanities more generally have introduced new approaches to and interpretations of literature, while also drawing from the spatially oriented interventions of scholars not necessarily associated with these emergent discourses. Among the most influential of these scholars, Edward W. Said represents an important figure in the development of spatially oriented cultural criticism. Although it would be misleading and anachronistic to characterize him as a geocritic, Said remains a powerful precursor whose writings on a vast range of subjects and topoi offer indispensable resources for geocritics and other scholars interested in the relations among spatiality, representation, and cultural forms. In his commitment to a critical approach that gave due attention to the geographical and historical registers of both narrative and lived experience, Said was an early trailblazer for critics now working in spatial literary studies.},

Topophrenia gathers essays by Robert Tally that explore the relationship between space, place, and mapping, on the one hand, and literary criticism, history, and theory on the other. The book provides an introduction to spatial literary studies, exploring in detail the theory and practice of geocriticism, literary cartography, and the spatial humanities more generally. The spatial anxiety of disorientation and the need to know one's location, even if only subconsciously, is a deeply felt and shared human experience. Building on Yi Fu Tuan's "topophilia" (or love of place), Tally instead considers the notion of "topophrenia" as a simultaneous sense of place-consciousness coupled with a feeling of disorder, anxiety, and "dis-ease." He argues that no effective geography could be complete without also incorporating an awareness of the lonely, loathsome, or frightening spaces that condition our understanding of that space. Tally considers the tension between the objective ordering of a space and the subjective ways in which narrative worlds are constructed. Narrative maps present a way of understanding that seems realistic but is completely figurative. So how can these maps be used to not only understand the real world but also to put up an alternative vision of what that world might otherwise be? From Tolkien to Cervantes, Borges to More, Topophrenia provides a clear and compelling explanation of how geocriticism, the spatial humanities, and literary cartography help us to narrate, represent, and understand our place in a constantly changing world"--},

HEI must integrate anti-racism agendas, challenge the European-centric academic knowledge domination, and dismantle power asymmetries. During the academic year 2021, GHSM executed (1) a gap analysis of undergraduate modules, (2) a course on decolonising research methods taught by global scholars to 40 Global South and North university students who completed pre- and post-course surveys, and (3) semi-structured interviews with 11 academics, and a focus group with four students exploring decolonising HEI; findings were thematically analysed. (1) Gap analysis revealed a tokenistic use of Black and minority ethnic and women authors across modules' readings. (2) The post-course survey showed that 68\% strongly agreed the course enhanced their decolonisation knowledge. (3) The thematic analysis identified themes: (1) Decolonisation is about challenging colonial legacies, racism, and knowledge production norms. (2) Decolonisation is about care, inclusivity, and compensation. (3) A decolonised curriculum should embed an anti-racism agenda, reflexive pedagogies, and life experiences involving students and communities. (4) HEI are colonial, exclusionary constructs that should shift to transformative and collaborative ways of thinking and knowing. (5) To decolonise research, we must rethink the hierarchy of knowledge production and dissemination and the politics of North-South research collaborations. Decolonising HEI must be placed within a human rights framework. HEI should integrate anti-racism agendas, give prominence to indigenous and marginalised histories and ways of knowing, and create a non-hierarchical educational environment, with students leading the decolonisation process.},

Historians and science studies researchers have long established the generative rather than simply illustrative role of images and figures within scientific practice. More recently, the deployment and generation of images by scientific research and its communication via publication has been impacted by the tools, techniques, and practices of working with large (image) datasets. Against this background, we built a dataset of 10 million-plus images drawn from all preprint articles deposited in the open access repository arXiv from 1991 (its inception) until the end of 2018. In this article, we suggest ways -- including algorithms drawn from machine learning that facilitate visually 'slicing' through the image data and metadata -- for exploring large datasets of statistical scientific images. By treating all forms of visual material found in scientific publications -- whether diagrams, photographs, or instrument data -- as bare images, we developed methods for tracking their movements across a range of scientific research. We suggest that such methods allow us different entry points into large scientific image datasets and that they initiate a new set of questions about how scientific representation might be operating at more-than-human scale.},

With the proliferation of online platforms where individuals can openly express their opinions and perspectives, it has become increasingly crucial for organizations to comprehend the underlying sentiments behind these opinions to make informed decisions. By comprehending the sentiments behind customers' opinions and attitudes towards products and services, companies can improve customer satisfaction, increase brand reputation, and ultimately increase revenue. Additionally, sentiment analysis can be applied to political analysis to understand public opinion toward political parties, candidates, and policies. Sentiment analysis can also be used in the financial industry to analyze news articles and social media posts to predict stock prices and identify potential investment opportunities. This paper offers an overview of the latest advancements in sentiment analysis, including preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, classification techniques, widely used datasets, and experimental results. Furthermore, this paper delves into the challenges posed by sentiment analysis datasets and discusses some limitations and future research prospects of sentiment analysis. Given the importance of sentiment analysis, this paper provides valuable insights into the current state of the field and serves as a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners. The information presented in this paper can inform stakeholders about the latest advancements in sentiment analysis and guide future research in the field.},

These processes draw upon specifically linguistic knowledge as well as knowledge about the world and the specific context of a sentence or utterance. This chapter also discusses the central theoretical perspectives and empirical questions that are guiding current research on sentence comprehension, and some historical perspective on how the field has developed. In doing so, it focuses primarily on the problem of how readers and listeners determine grammatical relationships as they are processing a sentence. In addition, the chapter also addresses the questions of how people pronounce words and nonwords, the effects of brain injury on performance, the role of phonological and morphological information in word recognition, the effects of differences among orthographies, the use of different decoding strategies, and the role of contextual information.},

Experiments using this paradigm have shown that visually presented referential information, including properties of referents relevant to specific actions, influences even the earliest moments of syntactic processing. Methodological concerns about task-specific strategies and the linking hypothesis between eye movements and linguistic processing are identified and discussed. These concerns are addressed in a review of recent studies of spoken word recognition which introduce and evaluate a detailed linking hypothesis between eye movements and lexical access. The results provide evidence about the time course of lexical activation that resolves some important theoretical issues in spoken-word recognition. They also demonstrate that fixations are sensitive to properties of the normal language-processing system that cannot be attributed to task-specific strategies.}

  abstract = {Over the last few years, smart cities have been a focus of scholarly attention. Most of these critical studies concentrated on the multinational corporations' discourses and their implications on urban policies. Besides these factors, however, the data-driven city develops within a complex web of entanglements whereby data-driven technologies modulate the urban infrastructure in a multitude of ways contingent upon the social, political, material and technical aspects. As such, this article attends to the infrastructural implications of a smart city product, Citymapper, which is a transport app built on open data available as part of London's smart city planning. In order to establish the relationship between data and infrastructure, I use Gilbert Simondon's notions of `transduction', `individuation' and `technicity' to explore this relationship in a processual and relational way. In constructing this relationship as co-generative, whereby infrastructure and data transindividuate, I subsequently posit the term data/infrastructure. Against this theoretical background, I study the ways in which Citymapper individuates and thereby gains infrastructural power through technicity of data by studying the ways in which the users' contribute to data generation that feed back into the app. Specifically, by following the transformation of the app from initially mediating the bus timetable to transducing users into environmental sensing nodes through which the app collects behavioural data, I foreground the epistemological, infrastructural and social consequences of Citymapper's infrastructural power for the data-driven city.},

By operating on generic object types, these packages unite research innovations in corpus linguistics, natural language processing, machine learning, statistics, and digital humanities. We begin by extrapolating on the theoretical benefits of R as an elaborate gluing language for bringing together several areas of expertise and compare it to linguistic concordancers and other tool-based approaches to text analysis in the digital humanities. We then showcase the practical benefits of an ecosystem by illustrating how R packages have been integrated into a digital humanities project.

Although the ratio of theory to data varies across chapters, each chapter is driven by a theoretical framework and each provides a review of at least some empirical work related to the theoretical ideas. In some cases the empirical work is new, not yet published elsewhere. Each chapter presents a story in progress--more remains to be done before the case is closed. This book was intended to pull together and present in a single place some of the research that is currently leading scientific inquiry into aspects of self and identity. If the work presented in this volume is representative of the research currently going on regarding the self, and we believe that it is, then the field is in very good shape. We are proud of the richness, thoughtfulness, depth, breadth, and creativity embodied in the work of our colleagues. We hope that you, too, will find these chapters informative and useful in your own work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Mining and analysis of the big data of Twitter conversations have been of significant interest to the scientific community in the fields of healthcare, epidemiology, big data, data science, computer science, and their related areas, as can be seen from several works in the last few years that focused on sentiment analysis and other forms of text analysis of tweets related to Ebola, E-Coli, Dengue, Human Papillomavirus (HPV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Measles, Zika virus, H1N1, influenza-like illness, swine flu, flu, Cholera, Listeriosis, cancer, Liver Disease, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, kidney disease, lupus, Parkinson's, Diphtheria, and West Nile virus. The recent outbreaks of COVID-19 and MPox have served as ``catalysts'' for Twitter usage related to seeking and sharing information, views, opinions, and sentiments involving both of these viruses. None of the prior works in this field analyzed tweets focusing on both COVID-19 and MPox simultaneously. To address this research gap, a total of 61,862 tweets that focused on MPox and COVID-19 simultaneously, posted between 7 May 2022 and 3 March 2023, were studied. The findings and contributions of this study are manifold. First, the results of sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning) approach shows that nearly half the tweets (46.88\%) had a negative sentiment. It was followed by tweets that had a positive sentiment (31.97\%) and tweets that had a neutral sentiment (21.14\%), respectively. Second, this paper presents the top 50 hashtags used in these tweets. Third, it presents the top 100 most frequently used words in these tweets after performing tokenization, removal of stopwords, and word frequency analysis. The findings indicate that tweets in this context included a high level of interest regarding COVID-19, MPox and other viruses, President Biden, and Ukraine. Finally, a comprehensive comparative study that compares the contributions of this paper with 49 prior works in this field is presented to further uphold the relevance and novelty of this work.},

Design/methodology/approach Problem-based learning is discussed as an approach for enabling sustainable management learning. Dewey's concepts of experience, inquiry and reflection are used to conceptualize learning as an iterative ``self-corrective'' learning process toward sustainability. Two public managers' experiences of a personal development module in a management education program are used to discuss how Dewey's concepts work to integrate practice and theory. Findings Dewey's problem-based learning framework has the potential to increase managers' capability to cope with complex and multifaceted challenges such as sustainability because of its focus on problem-solving. Practical implications Management is a social practice. Management education can support management learning if management is perceived as a practice. Originality/value Sustainable management learning is presented as an iterative and gradual learning process aimed toward settled inquiry that emerges when sustainable solutions work satisfactory in relation to the multiple and contradictory forces, which are in play in real-life situations.}

We evaluate token clusterings trained from several different output layers of popular contextualized language models. We find that BERT and GPT-2 produce high quality clusterings, but RoBERTa does not. These cluster models are simple, reliable, and can perform as well as, if not better than, LDA topic models, maintaining high topic quality even when the number of topics is large relative to the size of the local collection.},

Our analyses reveal distinct usage patterns of these markers and we effectively delineate their contextual features through the incorporation of eight syntactic and semantic variables. Our findings not only enhance the understanding of Chinese analytic causative constructions from the fourteenth to the twentieth century, but also provide corroborative evidence for previous research on synchronic variation.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence is everywhere, including seemingly adjacent to most historical research. As a stand-in for a plethora of methods, concepts, and theories, including machine learning (ML), natural language processing, and computer vision, the boundaries of artificial intelligence are so unclear and porous that they are hard to discern and even define. Historians have also been cautious to embrace the term, shaped by its association with the computational (social) sciences, important critiques of AI, and heated debates over computation in the humanities. For those who seek to signal the importance of these technologies to their practice, we often couch computational methods that fall under AI, such as text analysis and image analysis, under terms like ``digital humanities'' or ``digital history.'' Reading with and against the grain, identifying patterns and outliers, and toggling between close and distant reading are becoming analytical moves facilitated by artificial intelligence that are helping to rewrite how we understand the past.1 Ambitious projects such as the UK-based Living with Machines are also modeling how interdisciplinary teams can forge new AI approaches while writing new histories. It can be tempting to think that one isn't using or affected by artificial intelligence if they aren't using a tool like Mallet or programming with Python. Yet, arguably the most transformational and pervasive change for the field is AI's role in shaping how we organize and obtain historical sources, which is built around text search and browse.}

Students, however, do not seek to be retained. They seek to persist. The two perspectives, though necessarily related, are not the same. Their interests are different. While the institution's interest is to increase the proportion of their students who graduate from the institution, the student's interest is to complete a degree often without regard to the institution in which it is earned. Although there has been much written from the former point of view, much less has been written from the latter. This article seeks to address this imbalance by laying out a conceptual model of student institutional persistence as seen through the eyes of students.

  abstract = {This study evaluates the way in which interpreters activate the source language and the target language (TL) when they perform the interpreting task. We focused on syntactic ambiguities. In sentences like Someone shot the servant of the actress who was on the balcony, two antecedents (`servant' and `actress') are potential correct agents of the clause (who was on the balcony). Previous studies showed that Native English speakers interpret the second antecedent as the agent (actress); Spanish speakers prefer the first antecedent (servant), and Spanish--English bilinguals do not show any preference. In the present study, we observed the interpreters' syntactic processing when they either read the ambiguous sentences in Spanish to repeat them in Spanish or read the sentences in Spanish to translate them into English. The way ambiguous sentences were processed depended on the task: professionals did not show a clear attachment preference when they read and repeated sentences, while they used the strategy preferred in the TL when they performed the interpreting task. Interpreters managed TL syntactic properties in a flexible manner during the comprehension phase of the interpreting task.}

  address = {London},
  abstract = {This book takes the following question as its starting point: What are some of the crucial things the reader must do in order to make sense of a literary narrative? The book is a study of the texture of narrative fiction, using stylistics, corpus linguistic principles (especially Hoey's work on lexical patterning), narratological ideas, and cognitive stylistic work by Werth, Emmott, and others. Michael Toolan explores the textual/grammatical nature of fictional narratives, critically re-examining foundational ideas about the role of lexical patterning in narrative texts, and also engages the cognitive or psychological processes at play in literary reading. The study grows out of the theoretical questions that stylistic analyses of extended fictional texts raise, concerning the nature of narrative comprehension and the reader's experience in the course of reading narratives, and particularly concerning the role of language in that comprehension and experience. The ideas of situation, repetition and picturing are all central to the book's argument about how readers process story, and Toolan also considers the ethical and emotional involvement of the reader, developing hypotheses about the text-linguistic characteristics of the most ethically and emotionally involving portions of the stories examined. This book makes an important contribution to the study of narrative text and is in dialogue with recent work in corpus stylistics, cognitive stylistics, and literary text and texture.},

McMurtry's perspective provides an Anglo-European eye, influenced by Cervantean Iberian literary tropes on the transformation of the West from indigenous and Spanish trails to American rail-road tracks. The LA Noirscapes map phenomenologically illustrates how the location of novel settings cluster in contiguous and convergent places on a street grid palimpsest of Los Angeles between 1949 and 1997. Employing HumGIS methods, this essay considers the marriage of empirical cartography and impressionistic topography; the former concerned with latitude, longitude and space, the latter with plotting literary, historical and cultural perceptions and experiences of place. By engaging the concept of Euclidian space with the phenomenology of place, geographers can contextualize field work, and other methods with literary, cartographical and GIS analysis to uncover the means to craft new avenues to study the dynamic and symbiotic formations of historical landscapes, identities, senses of place and location.},

But what is climate change misinformation, who is involved, how does it spread, why does it matter, and what can be done about it? Climate change misinformation is closely linked to climate change skepticism, denial, and contrarianism. A network of actors are involved in financing, producing, and amplifying misinformation. Once in the public domain, characteristics of online social networks, such as homophily, polarization, and echo chambers---characteristics also found in climate change debate---provide fertile ground for misinformation to spread. Underlying belief systems and social norms, as well as psychological heuristics such as confirmation bias, are further factors which contribute to the spread of misinformation. A variety of ways to understand and address misinformation, from a diversity of disciplines, are discussed. These include educational, technological, regulatory, and psychological-based approaches. No single approach addresses all concerns about misinformation, and all have limitations, necessitating an interdisciplinary approach to tackle this multifaceted issue. Key research gaps include understanding the diffusion of climate change misinformation on social media, and examining whether misinformation extends to climate alarmism, as well as climate denial. This article explores the concepts of misinformation and disinformation and defines disinformation to be a subset of misinformation. A diversity of disciplinary and interdisciplinary literature is reviewed to fully interrogate the concept of misinformation---and within this, disinformation---particularly as it pertains to climate change.

  abstract = {21st-century journalism is characterized by new trends that facilitate the production of digital and novel contents. Among them, most notable is data-driven journalism, which collects structured information and analyzes it in-depth to present it in more versatile formats through interactive visualizations and other multimedia tools. This specialty serves to tell stories based on vast amounts of information that, without the assistance of a computer and the application of statistical methods, would be challenging to report. This work is a pilot study about the degree of penetration of data journalism through a comparative study of the journalistic media of the Spanish-speaking Caribbean. For this purpose, an exploratory pilot questionnaire investigated the processes and techniques used by journalists in the preparation of publications in digital media of Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic, in order to determine whether they apply data journalism from the defining elements that Paul Bradshaw establishes in his inverted pyramid of data journalism. The findings pointed out that journalists from these countries vary in the level of frequency of use of the five characteristic functions, of which the analysis of databases is the most used by all. The respondents agree that the least used data journalism techniques are the collection of data through contests or open collaboration projects (crowdsourcing) and the development of tools and informative web applications based on database contents. The digital journalists who have trained in this discipline did so, mainly, through workshops and practical seminars they took on their own initiative.           ,              El periodisme del segle XXI es caracteritza per noves tend{\`e}ncies que possibiliten la producci{\'o} de continguts digitals i nous.

The technical term is ``scalable,'' the ability to expand without distorting the framework. But it takes hard work to make knowledge and things scalable, and this article shows that ignoring nonscalable effects is a bad idea. People stumbled on scalable projects through the same historical contingencies that such projects set out to deny. They cobbled together ways to make things and data self-contained and static, and thus amenable to expansion. In European New World plantations, the natives were wiped out; coerced and alienated plants and workers came to substitute for them. Profits were made because extermination and slavery could be discounted from the books. Such historically indeterminate encounters formed models for later projects of scalability. This essay explores scalability projects from the perspective of an emergent ``nonscalability theory'' that pays attention to the mounting pile of ruins that scalability leaves behind. The article concludes that, if the world is still diverse and dynamic, it is because scalability never fulfills its own promises.},

  abstract = {In this essay I provide a comprehensive cognitive view of rhyme, one of the most powerful resources of poetic language. Readers and critics have strong intuitions on the matter of rhyme but find it difficult systematically to address its manifestations and the construction of its overall affect in the poetic passage. Hence critics all too frequently discuss rhymes impressionistically, in sporadic, ad hoc semantic analyses, and rely on readers to work out how these account for a poem's perceived affect(s). At other times critics ground their argu- ments in intertextuality, recasting rhyme as an enigma displaced from one text to another. Here I attempt to uncover the sources of possible affects of rhyme, suggesting critical tools for addressing it in a meaningful way in the hope of systematically relating its affects to its structure. Speech sounds are abstract cate- gories, from which rich precategorical sensory information is typically stripped away. Nevertheless, some of this information does reach the cognitive system, reverberating briefly in short-term memory and facilitating, by way of certain cognitive tasks, the processing of verbal material. Rhyme exploits and enhances this sensory information. There is some experimental evidence that memory traces of two words that appear consecutively, that is, spread out in time, may be fused and perceived as if they were simultaneously present. Basing some of my findings on adaptations of gestalt psychology, I suggest that similar processes may occur in the interaction between phonetic categories and the underlying acoustic information, enhancing them or toning them down. Further, I consider the possible interaction of semantic or thematic features with acoustic infor- mation underlying speech sounds, as well as some conditions that maximize our tendency to respond to groups of individual stimuli as unified "percepts," which may account for the perceived qualities regularly associated with certain rhyme patterns, and I examine the relatively rare dactylic rhyme in an attempt to account for some contradictions regularly ascribed to it},

The twelve chapters combine linguistic analysis with insights from cognitive psychology and cognitive linguistics in order to arrive at innovative accounts of a range of literary and textual phenomena. The chapters cover a variety of literary texts, periods, and genres, including poetry, fictional and non-fictional narratives, and plays. Some of the chapters provide new approaches to phenomena that have a long tradition in literary and linguistic studies (such as humour, characterisation, figurative language, and metre), others focus on phenomena that have not yet received adequate attention (such as split-selves phenomena, mind style, and spatial language). This book is relevant to students and scholars in a wide range of areas within linguistics, literary studies and cognitive science.},

  abstract = {This article addresses a current theoretical debate between the standard pragmatic model, the graded salience hypothesis, and the implicit display theory, by investigating the roles of the context and of the properties of the sarcastic utterance itself in the comprehension of a sarcastic remark. Two eye-tracking experiments were conducted where we manipulated the speaker's expectation in the context and the familiarity of the sarcastic remark. The results of the first eye-tracking study showed that literal comments were read faster than unfamiliar sarcastic comments, regardless of whether an explicit expectation was present in the context. The results of the second eye-tracking study indicated an early processing difficulty for unfamiliar sarcastic comments, but not for familiar sarcastic comments. Later reading time measures indicated a general difficulty for sarcastic comments. Overall, results seem to suggest that the familiarity of the utterance does indeed affect the time course of sarcasm processing (supporting the graded salience hypothesis), although there is no evidence that making the speaker's expectation explicit in the context affects it as well (thus failing to support the implicit display theory).}

This study aims to examine the integration and perceptions of SE within the higher education (HE) sector in India and identify any lessons that can be exported about the teaching of SE from the Indian HE environment.                                         Design/methodology/approach               Focusing on a science-based teaching and research institute at a private university in India, a quantitative, cross-sectional study examined the extent to which SE was integrated into the university and how it was perceived by students and staff. Data were collected through two online questionnaires administered to lecturers and undergraduate students during the 2017 academic year.                                         Findings               Most students reported that their university experiences had contributed significantly to their knowledge about sustainability. Results also showed there was a positive association between the teaching and learning about sustainability, although staff and students reported that this could be improved by including more active, student-centred teaching and learning approaches. However, students felt that they had learnt the most about sustainability from the informal ``hidden'' rather than the ``formal'' curriculum. This suggests that research is now required into ways to capitalise on this as a medium to further develop, not just Indian, but students' worldwide sustainability literacy.                                         Originality/value               To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first to present a detailed study of the perceptions of the contribution of the ``formal'' and the informal ``hidden'' curriculum to SE by students and staff at an Indian university.},

  abstract = {We present an algorithm for learning from unlabeled text, based on the Vector Space Model (VSM) of information retrieval, that can solve verbal analogy questions of the kind found in the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). A verbal analogy has the form A:B::C:D, meaning "A is to B as C is to D"; for example, mason:stone::carpenter:wood. SAT analogy questions provide a word pair, A:B, and the problem is to select the most analogous word pair, C:D, from a set of five choices. The VSM algorithm correctly answers 47\% of a collection of 374 college-level analogy questions (random guessing would yield 20\% correct). We motivate this research by relating it to work in cognitive science and linguistics, and by applying it to a difficult problem in natural language processing, determining semantic relations in noun-modifier pairs. The problem is to classify a noun-modifier pair, such as "laser printer", according to the semantic relation between the noun (printer) and the modifier (laser). We use a supervised nearest-neighbour algorithm that assigns a class to a given noun-modifier pair by finding the most analogous noun-modifier pair in the training data. With 30 classes of semantic relations, on a collection of 600 labeled noun-modifier pairs, the learning algorithm attains an F value of 26.5\% (random guessing: 3.3\%). With 5 classes of semantic relations, the F value is 43.2\% (random: 20\%). The performance is state-of-the-art for these challenging problems.},

This profoundly limits our ability to give instructions to computers, the ability of computers to explain their actions to us, and the ability of computers to analyse and process text. Vector space models (VSMs) of semantics are beginning to address these limits. This paper surveys the use of VSMs for semantic processing of text. We organize the literature on VSMs according to the structure of the matrix in a VSM. There are currently three broad classes of VSMs, based on term-document, word-context, and pair-pattern matrices, yielding three classes of applications. We survey a broad range of applications in these three categories and we take a detailed look at a specific open source project in each category. Our goal in this survey is to show the breadth of applications of VSMs for semantics, to provide a new perspective on VSMs for those who are already familiar with the area, and to provide pointers into the literature for those who are less familiar with the field.}

  abstract = {The literary genre of poetry is inherently related to the expression and elicitation of emotion via both content and form. To explore the nature of this affective impact at an extremely basic textual level, we collected ratings on eight different general affective meaning scales---valence, arousal, friendliness, sadness, spitefulness, poeticity, onomatopoeia, and liking---for 57 German poems (``die verteidigung der w{\"o}lfe'') which the contemporary author H. M. Enzensberger had labeled as either ``friendly'', ``sad'', or ``spiteful''. Following Jakobson's (1960) view on the vivid interplay of hierarchical text levels, we used multiple regression analyses to explore the specific influences of affective features from three different text levels (sublexical, lexical, and inter-lexical) on the perceived general affective meaning of the poems using three types of predictors: 1) Lexical predictor variables capturing the mean valence and arousal potential of words; 2) Inter-lexical predictors quantifying peaks, ranges and dynamic changes within the lexical affective content; 3) Sublexical measures of basic affective tone according to sound-meaning correspondences at the sublexical level (see Aryani, Kraxenberger, Ullrich, Jacobs, \& Conrad, 2016). We find the lexical predictors to account for a major amount of up to 50 \% of the variance in affective ratings. Moreover, inter-lexical and sublexical predictors account for a large portion of additional variance in the perceived general affective meaning. Together, the affective properties of all used textual features account for 43 to 70 \% of the variance in the affective ratings and still for 23 to 48 \% of the variance in the more abstract aesthetic ratings. In sum, our approach represents a novel method that successfully relates a prominent part of variance in perceived general affective meaning in this corpus of German poems to quantitative estimates of affective properties of textual components at the sublexical, lexical, and inter-lexical level.},

  abstract = {To mine large digital libraries in humanistically meaningful ways, scholars need to divide them by genre. This is a task that classification algorithms are well suited to assist, but they need adjustment to address the specific challenges of this domain. Digital libraries pose two problems of scale not usually found in the article datasets used to test these algorithms. 1) Because libraries span several centuries, the genres being identified may change gradually across the time axis. 2) Because volumes are much longer than articles, they tend to be internally heterogeneous, and the classification task needs to begin with segmentation. We describe a multi-layered solution that trains hidden Markov models to segment volumes, and uses ensembles of overlapping classifiers to address historical change. We test this approach on a collection of 469,200 volumes drawn from HathiTrust Digital Library. To demonstrate the humanistic value of these methods, we extract 32,209 volumes of fiction from the digital library, and trace the changing proportions of first- and third-person narration in the corpus. We note that narrative points of view seem to have strong associations with particular themes and genres.},

It would be better to understand this field as a conversation between literary studies and social science, inititated by scholars like Raymond Williams and Janice Radway, and moving slowly toward an explicitly experimental method. Candor about the social-scientific dimension of distant reading is needed now, in order to refocus a research agenda that can drift into diffuse exploration of digital tools. Clarity on this topic might also reduce miscommunication between distant readers and digital humanists.}

This larger setting for news, bound up in changes to economics, technology and culture, has created the conditions for a new subspecialty of the journalism profession to emerge: interactive journalism. In Interactive Journalism, Nikki Usher brings together a comprehensive theoretical and empirical portrait of this subspeciality. Beginning with a theoretical overview of professionalism, Usher provides a comprehensive history of fields that come together to define interactive journalism: computer assisted reporting, photojournalism and graphics. She then moves from the people behind interactive journalism to the work that these journalists do to the special abstract knowledge they provide the profession. With vignettes from across the world, she takes us from in-depth look at Al Jazeera English interactive creation to the BBC to the Guardian's data desk to the New York Times. Interactive Journalism illuminates the professions, people, work and knowledge of a subspeciality that has emerged in the age of the rise of digital culture as a possible answer to the decline and fall of traditional journalism"--},

According to our ongoing research on data journalism work methods, we can claim this has been an oversimplification. In this paper we will argue that all the brief definitions of data journalism lack nuances, and the multiple layers that contemporary data journalism already consists of in newsrooms. Based on six interviews of leading Finnish, American and British data journalists we can claim that there are already at least three different models for organizing data journalism work practices, and two main streams of data journalism, not just one.}

We review the literature on the reciprocal relationship between positive emotions and religion/spirituality and identify individual differences predicting greater positive emotions derived from engaging in religious practices. We suggest that beyond building religious/spiritual people's well-being, positive emotions play a role in sustaining otherwise costly religious behaviors. We integrate our review in the proposed Upward Spiral Theory of Sustained Religious Practice.}

Some others are to make the fiction more `real' or to present ideas about a character by using a name with certain meanings or associations to manipulate the reader's expectations. A description of the functions of a certain name in a certain text becomes relevant when the researcher can point out how it compares to the functions of other names and names in other texts. The article describes how research into names in literary texts needs a quantitative approach to reach a higher level of relevancy. To get a first impression of what may be normal in literary texts, a corpus of twenty-two Dutch and twenty-two English novels and ten translations into the other language in both sets were gathered. The occurrences of all names in these novels have been tagged for those data categories that seemed useful for the literary stylistic research planned. Some first results of the statistics are presented and the use of the approach is illustrated by means of an analysis of the use of geographical names in the Dutch novel Boven is het stil by Gerbrand Bakker and its English translation by David Colmer, The Twin. In the evaluation of the results, special attention is paid to the status of currently available digital tools for named entity recognition and classification, followed by a wish-list for the tools that this kind of research really needs.}

The background of the project is research in literary onomastics, the study of the usage and functions of proper names in literary (i.e. fictional) texts. The two main tasks for the project were to adapt existing Named Entity Recognition software to modern Dutch fiction, and to perform Named Entity Resolution by linking the names to Wikipedia entries. For Named Entity Recognition, existing tools have been trained on literary texts and a new NE tagger has been developed. The standard list of name categories had to be extended, since the analysis of the usage of proper names in literature needs to distinguish e.g. between first names and family names. The Named Entity Resolution task was done to explore the possibility of labeling the names in fiction in another way, by categorizing a name as referring to a person or location that only exist in the story of a fictional work (plot-internal names), or one referring to a person or location in the real world (plot-external names). This distinction is linked to the hypothesis that plot-internal and plot-external names can have different (stylistic and narrative) functions. Automatically marking them up is the first step toward testing that hypothesis on a large corpus. In this paper we describe the results of these two main tasks.}

Yet, in light of the increasing politicization of (climate) science, and the attempts of vested-interest groups to undermine the scientific consensus on climate change through organized disinformation campaigns, identifying ways to effectively engage with the public about the issue across the political spectrum has proven difficult. A growing body of research suggests that one promising way to counteract the politicization of science is to convey the high level of normative agreement (consensus) among experts about the reality of human-caused climate change. Yet, much prior research examining public opinion dynamics in the context of climate change has done so under conditions with limited external validity. Moreover, no research to date has examined how to protect the public from the spread of influential misinformation about climate change. The current research bridges this divide by exploring how people evaluate and process consensus cues in a polarized information environment. Furthermore, evidence is provided that it is possible to pre-emptively protect (inoculate) public attitudes about climate change against real-world misinformation.}

The study draws on a large corpus of (archived) developer pages and API reference documentation to examine the history of Facebook's API governance; that is, the governance of and by Facebook through its APIs. This historical analysis emphasizes the technical dimensions and dynamics of what, how, and whom powerful platforms seek to govern, thus highlighting the technicity of platform governance and how it evolved. Because APIs facilitate and govern the material conditions of app development and the social and economic processes they sustain, powerful platforms influence the evolution of their larger ecosystems. As such, the technicity of Facebook's API governance represents a major source of the platform's ``infrastructural power.''},

  abstract = {1. INTRODUCTION, AIMS. PROBLEMS In this paper we would like to apply some recent results from cognitive psychology to the study of literary discourse. These results pertain to processes of the reading and comprehension of discourse, and to the ways textual information is stored in, and retrieved from, memory. In the study of literature such results are of primary importance for the analysis of so-called interpretation and reception processes. Of course, the problem of how we understand a literary text has always been a main concern of both traditional and more recent literary scholarship: both in hermeneutics and in semantics it has been tried to account for the various kinds of meanings of literary texts. Such a meaning is assigned in a process of interpretation. Interpretation may be formal, i.e., formulated in terms of an explicit (grammatical or logical) semantics, or it may be more subjective in the sense of a hearer/reader assigning some meaning to a discourse. In order to get more insight into the ways actual readers of literature understand or interpret a literary text which is a necessary condition for further processing, e.g., the assignment of values to the text we need empirical psychological data about how language users read and understand a discourse. These applications from psychology to the study of literature are taking place within the more general development in poetics towards an interdisciplinary approach. More and more we have come to realize that literature is not merely a particular set of discourses, defined, perhaps, on the basis of specific textual properties. It should at the same time be viewed in terms of various aspects of communication. Thus, we may take literary texts, in pragmatics, as a kind of ritual}

Recent studies report that cyberbullying constitutes a growing problem among youngsters. Successful prevention depends on the adequate detection of potentially harmful messages and the information overload on the Web requires intelligent systems to identify potential risks automatically. The focus of this paper is on automatic cyberbullying detection in social media text by modelling posts written by bullies, victims, and bystanders of online bullying. We describe the collection and fine-grained annotation of a cyberbullying corpus for English and Dutch and perform a series of binary classification experiments to determine the feasibility of automatic cyberbullying detection. We make use of linear support vector machines exploiting a rich feature set and investigate which information sources contribute the most for the task. Experiments on a hold-out test set reveal promising results for the detection of cyberbullying-related posts. After optimisation of the hyperparameters, the classifier yields an F1 score of 64\% and 61\% for English and Dutch respectively, and considerably outperforms baseline systems.}

Concentrating on evaluation as a vital stage in the text generation process, the study demonstrates that benefit could be derived from literary theoretical perspectives.

Grammatical roles of eyewitnesses and non-eyewitnesses and the expressions referring to them were analyzed in four journalistic narratives about different shocking events and compared to four non-narrative news reports about the same events. Results show that in the narratives, but not in the news reports, eyewitnesses appear more often in subject position of a clause than non-eyewitnesses. This indicates that in narratives, journalists choose eyewitnesses as the lens through which they narrate the events. Furthermore, eyewitnesses are more often referred to with pronouns than nouns, whereas non-eyewitnesses are more often referred to with nouns than pronouns. This indicates that eyewitnesses are cognitively highly accessible in news narratives and that their viewpoints are conceptually most proximate to the viewpoints of journalist and reader. It is argued that the strategic use of grammatical roles and referential expressions in journalistic crime narratives puts the reader in the position of a "mediated witness".},

  abstract = {Current research on identification with narrative characters poses two problems. First, although identification is seen as a dynamic process of which the intensity varies during reading, it is usually measured by means of post-reading questionnaires containing self-report items. Second, it is not clear which linguistic characteristics evoke identification. The present paper proposes that an interdisciplinary framework allows for more precise manipulations and measurements of identification, which will ultimately advance our understanding of the antecedents and nature of this process. The central hypothesis of our Linguistic Cues Framework is that identification with a narrative character is a multidimensional experience for which different dimensions are evoked by different linguistic cues. The first part of the paper presents a literature review on identification, resulting in a renewed conceptualization of identification which distinguishes six dimensions: a spatiotemporal, a perceptual, a cognitive, a moral, an emotional, and an embodied dimension. The second part argues that each of these dimensions is influenced by specific linguistic cues which represent various aspects of the narrative character's perspective. The proposed relations between linguistic cues and identification dimensions are specified in six propositions. The third part discusses what psychological and neurocognitive methods enable the measurement of the various identification dimensions in order to test the propositions. By establishing explicit connections between the linguistic characteristics of narratives and readers' physical, psychological, and neurocognitive responses to narratives, this paper develops a research agenda for future empirical research on identification with narrative characters.}

  abstract = {The results reported by Kidd and Castano (2013) indicated that reading a short passage of literary fiction improves theory of mind (ToM) relative to reading popular fiction. However, when we entered Kidd and Castano's results in a p-curve analysis, it turned out that the evidential value of their findings is low. It is good practice to back up a p-curve analysis of a single paper with an adequately powered direct replication of at least one of the studies in the p-curve analysis. Therefore, we conducted a direct replication of the literary fiction condition and the popular fiction condition from Kidd and Castano's Experiment 5 to scrutinize the effect of reading literary fiction on ToM. The results of this replication were largely consistent with Kidd and Castano's original findings. Furthermore, we conducted a small-scale meta-analysis on the findings of the present study, those of Kidd and Castano and those reported in other published direct replications. The meta-analytic effect of reading literary fiction on ToM was small and non-significant but there was considerable heterogeneity between the included studies. The results of the present study and of the small-scale meta-analysis are discussed in the light of reading-times exclusion criteria as well as reliability and validity of ToM measures.}

It is argued that such studies are involved in an act of reification, in which, moreover, fundamental ingredients of the texts, e.g. their (highly important) range of figurative meanings, are eliminated from the analysis. Instead a concentration on lower levels of linguistic organization, such as grammar and lexis, may be observed, in spite of the fact that these are often the least relevant aspects of the text. In doing so, quantitative studies of literature significantly reduce not only the cultural value of texts, but also the generalizability of its own findings. What is needed, therefore, is an awareness and readiness to relate to matters of textuality as an organizing principle underlying the cultural functioning of literary works of art.}

  abstract = {Research in experimental aesthetics suggests a relation between complexity and novelty on the one hand and hedonic value on the other (Berlyne, 1980). Defining foregrounding as deviation from daily language, the concept seems closely associated with novelty, and therefore a relation may be expected between the degree of deviation and readers' aesthetic appreciation. Also, deviation is assumed to be the key to understanding style, and leads readers in their interpretation of a text. These hypotheses are confirmed by recent evidence (Miall and Kuiken, 1994; Hakemulder, 2004; Zyngier, van Peer and Hakemulder, in press). The present study aims to enhance control over potential factors, refining the assessment of readers' background variables, and excluding interference of text factors other than deviation. For this purpose six versions of one poetry line were written, with an ascending degree of foregrounding from the first to the sixth line. More than 300 participants were assigned randomly to a total of 13 groups. Some read one of the six lines of a poem. To other groups, adjacent lines were presented hierarchically or in a large difference in degree of foregrounding (four lines apart in the hierarchy). Participants evaluated the single line they had been assigned to, or compared their two lines on a number of items measuring aesthetic appreciation, evaluation of aesthetic structure, and perceived cognitive, emotive, social and attitudinal impact. In addition, they completed a questionnaire on reading habits. It was hypothesized that higher degrees of deviation would lead to higher scores on these measures. Part of the predictions was confirmed by the results.}

We note that the common sense of this word includes both benefits for confirmed predictions and costs for disconfirmed predictions. The N400 component of the event-related potential (ERP) reliably indexes the benefits of semantic context. Evidence that the N400 is sensitive to the other half of prediction -- a cost for failure -- is largely absent from the literature. This raises the possibility that ``prediction'' is not a good description of what comprehenders do. However, it need not be the case that the benefits and costs of prediction are evident in a single ERP component. Research outside of language processing indicates that late positive components of the ERP are very sensitive to disconfirmed predictions. We review late positive components elicited by words that are potentially more or less predictable from preceding sentence context. This survey suggests that late positive responses to unexpected words are fairly common, but that these consist of two distinct components with different scalp topographies, one associated with semantically incongruent words and one associated with congruent words. We conclude with a discussion of the possible cognitive correlates of these distinct late positivities and their relationships with more thoroughly characterized ERP components, namely the P300, P600 response to syntactic errors, and the ``old/new effect'' in studies of recognition memory.},

In this paper, we aim to bring both bodies of work together in a demonstration of a cognitive linguistic viewpoint analysis, providing the empirical work with theoretical means to interpret part of the findings, and the phenomenological work with an additional empirical ground. In particular, we employ a Deictic Navigation Network to analyze in detail the linguistic manifestations of viewpoint constructions in an authentic conversational narrative of a person diagnosed~with schizophrenia. These constructions are found to emerge from the use of tense shifts, spatial deixis, and speech and thought reports. This kind of viewpoint analysis elucidates the complexity of navigating subjective viewpoint structures in conversational narrative, both in linguistic and cognitive respect, and helps to identify potential problems in this navigation process. The final part of the paper discusses how these findings might add to our understanding of perspectivization issues in people with a schizophrenia diagnosis.},

While such distraction is typically regarded as potentially important in everyday life, previous work has so far not examined how deviant sounds affect performance on more complex daily tasks. In this study, we developed a new method to examine whether deviant sounds can disrupt reading performance by recording participants? eye movements. Participants read single sentences in silence and while listening to task-irrelevant sounds. In the latter condition, a 50-ms sound was played contingent on the fixation of five target words in the sentence. On most occasions, the same tone was presented (standard sound), whereas on rare and unexpected occasions it was replaced by white noise (deviant sound). The deviant sound resulted in significantly longer fixation durations on the target words relative to the standard sound. A time-course analysis showed that the deviant sound began to affect fixation durations around 180?ms after fixation onset. Furthermore, deviance distraction was not modulated by the lexical frequency of target words. In summary, fixation durations on the target words were longer immediately after the presentation of the deviant sound, but there was no evidence that it interfered with the lexical processing of these words. The present results are in line with the recent proposition that deviant sounds yield a temporary motor suppression and suggest that deviant sounds likely inhibit the programming of the next saccade.}

There is increasing evidence that skilled readers of English benefit from processing a parafoveal preview of a semantically related word. However, in previous investigations of semantic preview benefit using the gaze-contingent boundary paradigm the semantic relatedness between the preview and target has been confounded with the plausibility of the preview word in the sentence. In the present study, preview relatedness and plausibility were independently manipulated in neutral sentences read by a large sample of skilled adult readers. Participants were assessed on measures of reading and spelling ability to identify possible sources of individual differences in preview effects. The results showed that readers benefited from a preview of a plausible word, regardless of the semantic relatedness of the preview and the target. However, there was limited evidence of a semantic relatedness benefit when the plausibility of the preview was controlled. The plausibility preview benefit was strongest for low proficiency readers, suggesting that poorer readers were more likely to program a forward saccade based on information extracted from the preview. High proficiency readers showed equivalent disruption from all nonidentical previews suggesting that they were more likely to suffer interference from the orthographic mismatch between preview and target.},

This plausibility preview effect occurs irrespective of the semantic or orthographic relatedness of the preview and target word, suggesting that it depends on the degree to which a preview word fits the preceding context. The present study tested this hypothesis by examining the impact of contextual constraint on processing a plausible word in the parafovea. Participants' eye movements were recorded as they read sentences in which a target word was either highly predictable or unpredictable. The boundary paradigm was used to compare predictable, unpredictable, and implausible previews. The results showed that target predictability significantly modulated the effects of identical and plausible previews. Identical previews yielded significantly more benefit than plausible previews for highly predictable targets, but for unpredictable targets a plausible preview was as beneficial as an identical preview. The results shed light on the role of contextual predictability in early lexical processing. Furthermore, these data support the view that readers activate a set of appropriate words from the preceding sentence context, prior to the presentation of the target word.}

This assumption is challenged by evidence that readers are sensitive to the contextual plausibility of an upcoming word: First-pass fixation probability and duration are reduced when the parafoveal preview is a plausible, but unpredictable, word relative to an implausible word. The present study sought to establish whether the source of this effect is sensitivity to violations of syntactic acceptability. In two experiments, the gaze-contingent boundary paradigm was used to compare contextually plausible previews to semantically acceptable and anomalous previews that either matched or violated syntactic rules. Results showed that readers benefited from the convergence of semantic and syntactic acceptability early enough in the timecourse of reading to affect skipping. In addition, both semantic and syntactic plausibility yielded preview effects on target fixation duration measures, providing direct evidence of parafoveal syntactic processing in reading. These results highlight the limitations of relying solely on cloze probability to index contextual influences on early lexical processing. The implications of the data for models of eye movement control and language comprehension are discussed.}

My purpose in the present chapter is to apply the notion to certain phenomena of synchronic variation (in modern Dutch, but also observable in modern English) which look very similar to diachronic subjectification. In particular, I will examine the use of the predicates promise, threaten, and refuse in Dutch and English, focussing on the relation between descriptive (`objective') applications (as in He promised to defend the constitution) and modal (`subjective') uses (as in Thursday promises to be a very fine day. The incident threatened to ruin his chances).Whereas some other chapters in this volume (for example, by Elizabeth Traugott and Kathleen Carey) discuss details of the conceptual content of subjectification, the aim of this chapter is to extend the scope of this notion to new domains. Therefore I will not be concerned here with distinctions between different construals of the notion of subjectification (important as the issue may be), but rather start from what they have in common.I will try to show that an approach in terms of subjectification supplies us with a coherent conceptual framework for an integrated description of the use of the predicates mentioned above, provided that we are willing to take syntactic and discourse analytic considerations into account as well.},

  abstract = {Models of the reading process generally describe the relations among the compo-nents of reading in skilled readers. In these models, the relations between bottom-up word recognition processes (lower order processes) and top-down comprehension processes (higher order processes) are typically described. In bottom-up models of reading, processing starts with the raw input and passes through increasingly refined analyses until the meaning of the text is grasped. In top-down models, the decisions made at higher levels of processing are used to guide choices at lower levels. Research evidence makes it clear that neither purely bottom-up nor purely top-down models can fully explain the reading process (Rayner \& Pollatsek, 1989; Stanovich, 2000). An interactive model of ongoing top-down and bottom-up processes is therefore needed to imply that the reader uses both graphic and contextual information to grasp the meaning of a text (Perfetti, Landi, \& Oakhill, 2005; Verhoeven \& Perfetti, 2008). In the process of learning to read, children start out acquiring elementary decoding skills and learn to apply these with greater accuracy and speed. Word recognition subsequently becomes increasingly automatized by direct recognition of multi-letter units and whole words (Reitsma, 1983; Ziegler \& Goswami, 2005). Automatic word recognition enables children to devote their mental resources to the meaning of text rather than to recognizing words, allowing them to use reading as a tool to acquire new concepts and information (Perfetti, 1998; Samuels \& Flor, 1997). It is commonly assumed that both cognitive and linguistic factors have a great impact on reading acquisition and also on reading impairment. Role of cognitive and linguistic factors in reading acquisition From a cognitive point of view, information-processing theories occupy an important position in the study of children's reading development. Research has clearly shown information-processing factors to constrain children's word reading and reading comprehension processing (see Radach, Kennedy, \& Rayner, 2004). To begin with, attention can be seen as a prerequisite for effective reading. There is indeed research evidence showing the importance of attentional top-down control of visual information processing and saccadic eye-movements in reading (e.g., Schuett, Heywood, Kentridge, \& Zihl, 2008). Furthermore, it has been shown that limitations in attention may cause reading problems (Adams \& Snowling, 2001; Purvis \& Tannock, 2000). Besides, perception may also have an impact on children's reading acquisition. As a case in point, research has shown that problems in both auditory perception (cf. Tallal, 2000) and visual perception (Ramus, 2001) may lead to reading problems. In addition to attention and perception, working memory is one of the aspects of information processing studied most frequently in conjunction with children's reading development (cf. Seigneuric \& Ehrlich, 2005). In studies on the relation between working memory and reading development reported in the literature, the model of Baddeley is often used to describe the operation of working memory (Baddeley, 2003). The model involves two basic aspects where phonological and visual information are briefly and statically retained, namely the phonological loop and the visual sketchpad. The processing of phonological information is thought to have an inner rehearsal aspect (the articulatory loop) which allows the phonological information needed for the processes of word decoding and reading comprehension to be retained longer in memory. Research evidence for the importance of the phonological loop in reading comes from studies in which phonological working memory has been tested by asking children to repeat series of words (e.g., Nation, Adams, Bowyer-Crane, \& Snowling, 1999), series of nonwords (e.g., Gathercole, Willis, Baddeley, \& Emslie, 1994), or sentence completion tasks (Siegel \& Ryan, 1989). A third more central aspect of Baddeley's model is the central-executive system which constitutes the control mechanism to coordinate the storage and processing of basic information. With respect to the relation between the central-executive memory functioning of children and reading development, it has been shown that problems switching between different aspects of information-processing can correlate with language development problems (Baddeley \& Della Sala, 1998). There is general agreement that in the case of alphabetic writing systems the acquisition of literacy involves the rediscovering of the principles of phonological recoding (Ehri, 1999). In the process of understanding written language, children begin with a rough approach of a limited collection of words that have personal meaning to them. Subsequently, they discover the alphabetic principle on the basis of an analysis of familiar words involving their constituent sounds and letters. 388 L. Verhoeven et al.},

In order to have a greater access to the valuable information present in the ancient scripts, an appropriate translation system needs to be developed keeping complexity and very less knowledge of the script available in consideration. In this study, a translation and prediction system has been implemented using Artificial Intelligence. The training has been developed using Sunda-Dataset and self-generated dataset, whereas the translation from ancient script viz. Sundanese script to English text is done using two layers Recurrent Neural Network. The technique used is compared with an existing translator called IM Translator. The results shows that the BLEU score~ is increased by 8\% in comparison to IM Translator further WER is decreased~ by 10\% in contrast to IM Translator.~ Furthermore, the N-Gram analysis results indicate 3\% to 4\% increase in 100\% contrast value.},

  abstract = {Listeners generally attempt to understand oral conversational stories by figuring out what the narrator is `getting at'; their understanding is point-driven in this sense. Analogously, a form of reading in which readers expect to be able to impute motives to authors may also be called point-driven; it is a mode that seems especially useful for reading so-called `literary' texts. Point-driven reading is conceptually distinguishable from story-driven and information-driven types. We argue that each type is asociated with a number of cognitive strategies, with point-driven reading, specifically, characterized by coherence, narrative surface, and transactional strategies. Using a modern short story, we illustrate how point-driven readings might be differentiated from other kinds. An advantage of this conceptualization is that it enables one to generate empirically testable hypotheses about literary reading; we suggest a number of such hypotheses and methods of testing them.}

We propose a fine-tuned model that jointly integrates entity recognition and disambiguation in a unified framework. Furthermore, our approach leverages large language models to enrich the context of entity mentions, yielding better disambiguation. We evaluated our approach on benchmark datasets and compared with several baselines. The evaluation results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on out-of-domain datasets.}

Although this gives rise to the well-known multiple comparisons problem, i.e. an inflated probability that the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected (Type I error), it is accepted standard practice not to apply any correction procedures. Instead, there appears to be a widespread belief that corrections are not necessary because the increase in false positives is too small to matter. To our knowledge, no formal argument has ever been presented to justify this assumption. Here, we report a computational investigation of this issue using Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, false positives are increased to unacceptable levels when no corrections are applied. Our simulations also show that counter-measures like the Bonferroni correction keep false positives in check while reducing statistical power only moderately. Hence, there is little reason why such corrections should not be made a standard requirement. Further, we discuss three statistical illusions that can arise when statistical power is low, and we show how power can be improved to prevent these illusions. In sum, our work renders a detailed picture of the various types of statistical errors than can occur in studies of reading behavior and we provide concrete guidance about how these errors can be avoided.}

We begin by exploring how crowdsourced tagging systems like those found on Goodreads have influenced the evolution of genre among readers and amateur critics, and we highlight the contemporary value of the ``classics'' in particu-lar. We identify the most commonly tagged ``classic'' literary works and find that Goodreads users have curated a vision of literature that is less diverse, in terms of the race and ethnicity of authors, than many U.S. high school and college syllabi. Drawing on computational methods such as topic modeling, we point to some of the forces that influence readers' perceptions, such as schooling and what we call the classic industry --- industries that benefit from the reinforcement of works as classics in other mediums and domains like film, television, publishing, and e-commerce (e.g., Goodreads and Amazon). We also high-light themes that users commonly discuss in their reviews (e.g., boring characters) and writing styles that often stand out in them (e.g., conversational and slangy language). Throughout the essay, we make the case that computational methods and internet data, when combined, can help literary critics capture the creative explosion of reader responses and critique algorithmic culture's effects on literary history.},

  abstract = {Purpose               The purpose of this paper is to conduct a retrospective bibliometric analysis of documents about digital humanities, an emerging but interdisciplinary movement. It examines the distribution of research outputs and languages, identifies the active journals and institutions, dissects the network of categories and cited references, and interprets the hot research topics.                                         Design/methodology/approach               The source data are derived from the Web of Science (WoS) core collection. To reveal the holistic landscape of this field, VOSviewer and CiteSpace as popular visualization tools are employed to process the bibliographic data including author, category, reference, and keyword. Furthermore, the parameter design of the visualization tools follows the general procedures and methods for bibliometric analysis.                                         Findings               There is an obviously rapid growth in digital humanities research. English is still the leading academic language in this field. The most influential authors all come from or have scientific relationships with Europe and North America, and two leading countries of which are the UK and USA. Digital humanities is the result of a dynamic dialogue between humanistic exploration and digital means. This research field is closely associated with history, literary and cultural heritage, and information and library science.                                         Research limitations/implications               This analysis relies on the metadata information extracted from the WoS database; however, some valuable literatures in the field of digital humanities may not be retrieved from the database owing to the inherent challenge of topic search. This study is also restricted by the scope of publications, the limitation regarding the source of data is that WoS database may have underrepresented publications in this domain.                                         Originality/value               The output of this paper could be a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners interesting in the knowledge domain of digital humanities. Moreover, the conclusions of this retrospective analysis can be deemed as the comparable foundation for future study.},

However, the concept of fake news is still ambiguous, and the boundary between the definition of fake news and other relative concepts, such as news satire, yellow journalism, junk news, pseudo-news, hoax news, propaganda news, advertorial, false information, fake information, misinformation, disinformation, mal-information, alternative fact, and post-truth is blurred. The present study aims to identify the meanings of fake news and other related concepts, and explore the recent trend of research on them. By searching the journals listed in the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-Expanded) database, the present study found 387 articles on fake news. Through analyzing these articles, the present study maps the trend and reveals the highly influential research articles, as well as theories and concepts that are used. The results may provide fundamental insights into the development of research on fake news in recent years.}

Three components of emotions are traditionally distinguished: valence (the pleasantness of a stimulus), arousal (the intensity of emotion provoked by a stimulus), and dominance (the degree of control exerted by a stimulus). Thus far, nearly all research has been based on the ANEW norms collected by Bradley and Lang (1999) for 1,034 words. We extended that database to nearly 14,000 English lemmas, providing researchers with a much richer source of information, including gender, age, and educational differences in emotion norms. As an example of the new possibilities, we included stimuli from nearly all of the category norms (e.g., types of diseases, occupations, and taboo words) collected by Van Overschelde, Rawson, and Dunlosky (Journal of Memory and Language 50:289-335, 2004), making it possible to include affect in studies of semantic memory.}

  abstract = {Thing theory names an approach that scholars use to investigate human-object relations in art, literature, culture, and everyday life. Though commonly thought of as a way to study physical artifacts, thing theory is rather a means to explore the dynamics between human subjects and inanimate objects. Thing theory emerges from the scholarly concern with commodity capitalism, and therefore has many antecedents in anthropology, art history, and museum studies. But it more precisely names the theoretical framework that developed within English departments in the 1990s, and prompted literary studies to turn upon the object matter of literature. The phrase ``thing theory'' came widely into use in 2001, in Bill Brown's introduction to a special issue of Critical Inquiry titled Things. There, Brown describes the questions that thing theory raises as queries not into objects alone, but into subject-object relations in particular spaces, at particular times. Literature was central to these queries, not only because English departments in the 1990s were home to the ``high theory'' that Brown draws upon, but because, as he argues, it is a privileged medium for revealing the force of inanimate objects in human experience. In other words, literature makes the ``thingness'' of objects visible. This distinction comes from Heidegger, for whom objects become things when they can no longer serve their common or intended function. When an object breaks or is misused, it sheds its conventional role and becomes visible in new ways: it becomes a thing. Thing theory draws upon this notion of productive estrangement to consider the meaning that physical artifacts can have for human subjects. While thing theory entails discussions of ``real'' artifacts, it has primarily been used by scholars in the humanities to discuss the representation of such things in art and literature---specifically as a means to understand what meaning such representations hold. Around 2010, a number of books about the agency of objects by philosophers, political scientists, and media studies scholars inaugurated what might be called a second phase of thing theory. This second phase entailed scholars seeking to decenter the human subject in their materialist studies. These ``new materialisms'' are less confined to representational forms and have expanded the reach of thing theory well beyond literary studies. The new materialisms---some of which build directly on an older Marxist tradition of historical materialism---and other branches of thought that attempt to decenter the human, including object-oriented ontology, actor-network theory, ecocriticism, and posthumanism, draw upon thing theory but might best be thought of as a set of allied approaches interested in the agency of things. This bibliography tracks the initial phase of thing theory in literary studies, consolidates the earlier scholarship it draws on most consistently, outlines the second phase of thing theory across a variety of fields, and looks to work that has inaugurated new, future directions.},

In recent years, with the rapid expansion of Internet text data scale and the rapid development of deep learning technology, a large number of deep neural network-based methods have emerged, which have greatly improved the accuracy of recognition. This paper attempts to summarize the traditional methods and the latest research progress in the field of named entity identification, and summarize and analyse its main models, algorithms and applications. Finally, the future development trend of named entity recognition is discussed.},

This paradigm should be useful in assessing impediments in speech processing. In this paradigm, two scenes, a target picture and a competitor picture, were presented simultaneously with an aurally presented sentence that corresponded to the target picture. At the same time, eye fixations were recorded using an eye-tracking device. The effect of linguistic complexity on language processing time was assessed from eye fixation information by systematically varying linguistic complexity. This was achieved with a sentence corpus containing seven German sentence structures. A novel data analysis method computed the average tendency to fixate the target picture as a function of time during sentence processing. This allowed identification of the point in time at which the participant understood the sentence, referred to as the decision moment. Systematic differences in processing time were observed as a function of linguistic complexity. These differences in processing time may be used to assess the efficiency of cognitive processes involved in resolving linguistic complexity. Thus, the proposed method enables a temporal analysis of the speech comprehension process and has potential applications in speech audiology and psychoacoustics.},

Shakespeare's oft-quoted line contains a hidden ambiguity: not only do individual people experience time differently, but time travels in diverse paces when we are with diverse persons. The line articulates a contemporary understanding of subjective time: it is changed by interaction with our social environment. Interacting with other people--and even literary characters--can slow or quicken the experience of time. Interactive time, and the paradigm of enactive cognition in which it sits, calls for an expansion of traditional ideas of time in narrative. The first book-length study of interactive time in narrative, Catching Time explains how lived time and narrative time interpenetrate each other, so that the relational model of subjective time acts as a narrative function. Catching Time develops a novel, interdisciplinary framework, drawing on cognitive science, narratology, and linguistics, to understand the patterns of temporality that shape narrative"--},

In literary studies, practical criticism is typically regarded as a method of reading that focuses on the text itself and that isolates the text from its social and historical context. Yet, Richards? technique of issuing his student audiences with anonymized and unknown poems, and asking them for their written responses (or ?protocols?), was explicitly part of a psychological experiment and not a model of how we should, or even could, read literature. And he was primarily ? if not exclusively ? interested in the responses of his readers to the poem and not in the poem itself. I have argued that Richards? technique of practical criticism was the very first large-scale experiment in psychology conducted to discover how real readers understand, interpret and evaluate literary texts. As such, the experiment anticipated the relatively recent turn among stylisticians towards empirical research, and might still be able to inform that research. In this article, I compare Richards? experiment with the psychological and aesthetic experiments that had been conducted beforehand. I then describe in detail what Richards actually did in his experiment, and assess the strengths and weaknesses of his methodology. Finally, I assess some of the ways in which Richards? experiment might inform empirical research in stylistics today.}

In this paper we propose an algorithmic method for evaluating sets of basic emotion labels that relies upon computed co-occurrence distances between words in a 12.7-billion-word corpus of unselected text from USENET discussion groups. Our method uses the relationship between human arousal and valence ratings collected for a large list of words, and the co-occurrence similarity between each word and emotion labels. We assess how well the words in each of 12 emotion label sets?proposed by various researchers over the past 118 years?predict the arousal and valence ratings on a test and validation dataset, each consisting of over 5970 items. We also assess how well these emotion labels predict lexical decision residuals (LDRTs), after co-varying out the effects attributable to basic lexical predictors. We then demonstrate a generalization of our method to determine the most predictive ?basic? emotion labels from among all of the putative models of basic emotion that we considered. As well as contributing empirical data towards the development of a more rigorous definition of basic emotions, our method makes it possible to derive principled computational estimates of emotionality?specifically, of arousal and valence?for all words in the language.}

In it, we argue that research into reader response should be recognised as a vital aspect of contemporary stylistics, and we establish our focus on work which explicitly investigates such responses through the collection and analysis of extra-textual datasets. Reader response research in stylistics is characterised by a commitment to rigorous and evidence-based approaches to the study of readers' interactions with and around texts, and the application of such datasets in the service of stylistic concerns, to contribute to stylistic textual analysis and/or wider discussion of stylistic theory and methods. We trace the influence of reader response criticism and reception theory on stylistics and discuss the productive dialogues which exist between stylistics and the related fields of the empirical study of literature and naturalistic study of reading. After offering an overview of methods available to reader response researchers and a contextualising survey of existing work, we argue that both experimental and naturalistic methods should be regarded as `empirical', and that stylistics is uniquely positioned to embrace diverse approaches to readers and reading. We summarise contributions to the special issue and the valuable insights they offer into the historical context of reader response research and the way readers perceive and evaluate texts (either poetry or narrative prose). Stylistic reader response research enables both the testing and development of stylistic methods, in accordance with the progressive spirit of the discipline, and also the establishment of new and renewed connections between stylistic research and work in other fields.},

  abstract = {Despite the rapid growth of research on organizational sensemaking and an acknowledgment of the critical role of language in the sensemaking process, the literature on sensemaking and language is fragmented. In particular, there is no systematic review that explains the roles and functions of different linguistic elements in meaning construction. The purpose of this review paper is to develop an integrative theoretical framework that organizes existing research in a way that allows us to better understand how different linguistic processes shape the construction of meaning in sensemaking. First, we explain how a cognitive linguistic perspective elucidates how language provides the cognitive associations, schema, and frames used in sensemaking. Second, we discuss how a focus on the social practices of language use, as in rhetorical, narrative, or interactionist approaches, illuminates the patterns of meaning-making among organizational members in social interaction. Third, we explain how a focus on discourse helps us to understand how discursive structures enable or constrain sensemaking and thereby reproduce or transform systems of thought. This leads us to turn to the differences in these perspectives and suggest how they can be brought together in an integrative theoretical framework. Finally, we discuss the contributions of our framework and propose an agenda for future research focusing on the multifaceted role of language in sensemaking, intertextual and multimodal links in the language of sensemaking, the agentic and structural role of language in sensemaking, episodic and latent aspects of language use in sensemaking, and the role of power in discursive sensemaking.},

Theorisations of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) identities are necessarily rooted in an analysis of discourse. Representation is important because those with the power to do so construct and reproduce shared meanings that may then become accepted as common sense. This review will begin with corpus studies that consider LGBT representation in governmental debates. It will then consider representation in the press by discussing studies that have looked specifically at trans representation as well as at diachronic approaches to corpus-based discourse analysis. Press representation is a common focus of corpus-based discourse analysis of LGBT identities.},

We investigated the neural basis of 2 distinct aspects of word prediction, derived from information theory, during story comprehension. We assessed the effect of entropy of next-word probability distributions as well as surprisal. A computational model determined entropy and surprisal for each word in 3 literary stories. Twenty-four healthy participants listened to the same 3 stories while their brain activation was measured using fMRI. Reversed speech fragments were presented as a control condition. Brain areas sensitive to entropy were left ventral premotor cortex, left middle frontal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule, and left supplementary motor area. Areas sensitive to surprisal were left inferior temporal sulcus ("visual word form area"), bilateral superior temporal gyrus, right amygdala, bilateral anterior temporal poles, and right inferior frontal sulcus. We conclude that prediction during language comprehension can occur at several levels of processing, including at the level of word form. Our study exemplifies the power of combining computational linguistics with cognitive neuroscience, and additionally underlines the feasibility of studying continuous spoken language materials with fMRI.}

Subsequent research has, however, convinced me that I was wrong on both accounts, particularly as to the constraints of short-term memory on verse-length.

While there is a vast theoretical literature on suspense, it is computationally not well understood. We compare two ways for modelling suspense: surprise, a backward-looking measure of how unexpected the current state is given the story so far; and uncertainty reduction, a forward-looking measure of how unexpected the continuation of the story is. Both can be computed either directly over story representations or over their probability distributions. We propose a hierarchical language model that encodes stories and computes surprise and uncertainty reduction. Evaluating against short stories annotated with human suspense judgements, we find that uncertainty reduction over representations is the best predictor, resulting in near human accuracy. We also show that uncertainty reduction can be used to predict suspenseful events in movie synopses.}

Traditionally, toponyms are collected in a gazetteer through field surveys that require significant resources, including labor, time, and money. Nowadays, we can utilize social media and online news portals to collect event locations or toponyms from the text. This article presents a survey of studies that focus on the extraction and disambiguation of toponyms from textual documents. While toponym extraction aims to identify toponyms from the text, toponym disambiguation determines their specific locations on the earth. The survey covered articles published between January 2015 and April 2023, presented in English, and gathered from five major journal databases. The survey was conducted by adopting the Kitchenham guidelines, consisting of an initial article search, article selection, and annotation process to facilitate the reporting phase. We employed Mendeley as a reference management tool and NVivo to categorize certain parts of the articles that are the focal points of interest in this survey. The primary focus of the survey was on the methods or approaches performed in the research articles to extract and disambiguate toponyms. Additionally, we also discuss some general challenges in toponym research, different applications for toponym extraction and disambiguation, data sources, and the use of languages other than English in the studies. The survey confirms that each approach has its limitations. Extracting and disambiguating toponyms from text is complex and challenging, especially for low-resource languages. We also suggest some research directions related to toponym extraction and disambiguation that could enrich the gazetteer.},

This tutorial introduces readers to mixed models, Growth Curve Analysis (GCA) and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). These approaches are ideal for analyzing nonlinear change over time where there are nested dependencies, such as time points within dyad (in repeated interaction experiments) or time points within chain (in iterated learning experiments). In addition, the tutorial gives recommendations for choices about model fitting. Annotated scripts in the online Supplementary Data provide the reader with R code to serve as a springboard for the reader's own analyses.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            The article, on the ``scope of empirical narratology'', offers a survey of the emerging field of empirical narratology, which arguably originates with the publication of               Psychonarratology               (Bortolussi and Dixon 2003). To situate empirical approaches in narratology, the article first outlines the current discussion in the field, which is divided as to whether empirical methodologies represent a un-/helpful addition to the discipline. After that, three major methods of conducting empirical research in narratology are introduced: i. e., a qualitative, quantitative / corpus-based, and quantitative / experimental approach. Each method is discussed and illustrated with a model study from current research. Finally, the article suggests topics for further investigation in the empirical paradigm. By presenting tenets and study models for empirical narratology, the article hopes to highlight its attractiveness for narratology at large, and to advance the developing framework.}

  abstract = {Fake news is big news. From the diffusion of rumors and conspiracies in the United States to the spread of disinformation by Russian troll farms, misinformation is a hot topic among academics and journalists alike. How can we understand and correct such misinformation? A logical starting point is to fight fiction with fact. Indeed, many proposed solutions to the problem of misinformation assume that the proper remedy is merely to provide more information. In this view, if citizens were only better informed, misinformation would lose its power. However, ample research suggests that the answer is not so simple. Misinformation may continue to endure postcorrection for several reasons. First, corrections are rarely able to fully eliminate reliance on misinformation in later judgments. Even when people recall hearing a retraction, the original misinformation may still influence their attitudes and beliefs (what is known as the continued influence effect). Worse yet, people may come to believe in misinformation even more strongly post-correction. In particular, retractions that run counter to individuals' prior attitudes may bolster beliefs in the original misinformation (what are known as worldview backfire effects). These worldview backfire effects have their roots in directionally motivated reasoning; individuals process misinformation and corrections through the lens of their preexisting beliefs and partisan attachments, so they may actively dispute corrections that contradict their broader worldviews. Although political misinformation is not a new phenomenon, the topic has received renewed attention in recent years, in conjunction with sweeping changes in the contemporary media environment. As the Internet and, particularly, social media become an increasingly common source for political information (Shearer and Matsa 2018), citizens receive more and more of their news in an uncontrolled and minimally regulated setting where misinformation may easily spread (Vosoughi, Roy, and Aral 2018). Validating these concerns, numerous studies of ``fake news'' spotlight social media platforms, including both Facebook and Twitter, as the primary incubators of misinformation}

In their study, conservatives presented with factual information about the absence of Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq became more convinced that such weapons had been found. The present paper presents results from five experiments in which we enrolled more than 10,100 subjects and tested 52 issues of potential backfire. Across all experiments, we found no corrections capable of triggering backfire, despite testing precisely the kinds of polarized issues where backfire should be expected. Evidence of factual backfire is far more tenuous than prior research suggests. By and large, citizens heed factual information, even when such information challenges their ideological commitments.}

Others reveal how things went wrong in the research process, even past the point of recovery, and what was learned. There is reflection on wider conceptual, theoretical, and ethical debates about 'religion' and what they mean in practice. In acknowledging the messiness of researching religion, the volume seeks to humanize and improve it. The honest reflections it contains will help researchers avoid some common mistakes and messes, and face others openly without losing heart"--},

Over the last twenty years, computer scientists have developed a wide range of statistical procedures using a number of different linguistic features to measure similarity between texts. However, much of this work is not of practical use to forensic linguists who need to explain in reports or in court why a particular method of identifying potential authors works. This paper sets out to address this problem using a corpus linguistic approach and the 176-author 2.5 million-word Enron Email Corpus. Drawing on literature positing the idiolectal nature of collocations, phrases and word sequences, this paper tests the accuracy of word n-grams in identifying the authors of anonymised email samples. Moving beyond the statistical analysis, the usage-based concept of entrenchment is offered as a means by which to account for the recurring and distinctive production of idiolectal word n-grams.},

Using a machine learning- based predictive modeling approach five `surface' features (word length, orthographic neighborhood density, word frequency, orthographic dissimilarity and sonority score) were detected as important predictors of total reading time and fixation probability in poetry reading. The fact that one phonological feature, i.e., sonority score, also played a role is in line with current theorizing on poetry reading. Our approach opens new ways for future eye movement research on reading poetic texts and other complex literary materials (cf. Jacobs, 2015c).}

They not only narrate the biographies of the websites but also the autobiographies of the story-tellers. The main biographical plot in these narratives of disappeared websites is a lovely life that was tragically cut short. Disappeared websites are most remembered for the passion, community, and sense of youthful idealism which they had inspired. Remembrances of disappeared websites are both retrospective and prospective. They resuscitate a lost golden age while expressing voices of protest at Internet censorship.

  abstract = {Approximately 30\% of students who enter the postsecondary education system do so through 2-year colleges. The majority of these students intend to earn a bachelor's degree, but most leave college before earning a diploma from a 4-year institution. The discrepancy between bachelor's degree aspirations and degree attainment rates of students who enter through 2-year colleges suggests that vertical transfer students---those who transfer from 2- to 4-year colleges---face unique obstacles to academic performance and retention that affect their likelihood of earning a bachelor's degree. Similar barriers exist for economically disadvantaged students, who may be more likely to enter the postsecondary education system through 2-year colleges. This scoping review synthesizes the literature on factors influencing economically disadvantaged vertical transfer students' academic performance in the first year posttransfer and retention between the first and second year posttransfer. Implications for 2- and 4-year institutions and recommendations for future research are discussed.},

Yet while many studies have explored individual students' drawing, few studies have looked into drawing as a collective tool to engage students in thinking and talking together in science classrooms. This study employed a case study approach to understand some of the possibilities for visual representation construction as a collective reasoning tool. By examining two cases of visual representation construction during classroom talk in two elementary science classrooms, this study demonstrates how teachers use visual representation as an instructional strategy, and how visualization engages students' reasoning, meaning making, and social interactions. We selected two cases that demonstrate the emergence of the teacher's and students' drawing activities and analyzed each with a focus on the interactions that occur during the construction of visual representation and how this interaction promotes scientific reasoning and meaning making. For the case analysis, three researchers reviewed the video cases separately several times, and then collectively developed in-depth discussion to bring forth possible themes. The findings include (a) that there were common grounds of visual representation established for collective reasoning, and (b) that visual representations expanded knowledge and reasoning from the individual to social level, thus playing a critical role in students' reasoning and knowledge building during classroom talk. Pedagogical questions and reflection are discussed for further research on visualization as a cognitive and social tool in classrooms.},

We conducted a meta-analysis in which the effects of statistical and narrative evidence on beliefs, attitude, and intention were separately compared. Statistical evidence was found to have a stronger influence than narrative evidence on beliefs and attitude, whereas narrative evidence had a stronger influence on intention. We explain these findings in terms of the match between the specific characteristics of the two types of evidence and those of the outcome variables. Statistical evidence, beliefs, and attitude all relate primarily to cognitive responses, whereas both narrative evidence and intention relate more specifically to affective responses. We conclude that communication professionals developing health campaigns should match the type of evidence to the main communication objectives.}

Whether emotional arousal influences affective priming remains poorly understood. The present study demonstrates how arousal impacts evaluation of affective words using reaction time and event-related potential (ERP) measures. Eighteen younger subjects evaluated pleasantness of target words after seeing affective pictures as primes. The participants' responses were faster and/or more accurate for valence-congruent trials than for incongruent trials, particularly with high-arousal stimuli. An ERP affective priming effect (N400) also occurred mainly in high-arousing stimulus pairs. In addition, whereas valence congruency influenced both the N400 and the LPP, arousal congruency influenced only the LPP, suggesting that arousal congruency mainly modulates post-semantic processes, but valence congruency effects begin with semantic processes. Overall, our current findings indicate that the arousal level of visual images impacts both behavioral and ERP effects of affective priming.},

The present study combined ERP with a rapid serial visual presentation with flanker (RSVP-flanker) method to examine this issue when words were presented in the parafovea. We manipulated three kinds of critical words: expected (EXP), semantically violated (VIO) and semantically cohort violated (COH-VIO). The ERP results showed that the parafoveal N400 effect was delayed in the contrast of COH-VIO vs. EXP than the contrast of VIO vs. EXP. These results suggested that the semantic context influences parafoveal word processing before word identification in written language comprehension.},

Under the background of digital China strategy and sustainable energy transformation in the post-COVID-19 era, it is meaningful to investigate the relationship between the digital economy and green total factor energy efficiency (GTFEE) to better drive the development of the digital economy and improve GTFEE. For this purpose, this study estimates deeply the impact of the digital economy on GTFEE by applying ordinary least squares (OLS), panel vector autoregression (PVAR), panel threshold, and mediation effect models based on panel data of 30 Chinese provinces from 2006 to 2018. The statistical results indicate that digital economy is conducive to improving GTFEE. Digital economy can significantly contribute to GTFEE by improving economic growth level, urbanization level, R\&amp;D investment, and human capital. The most interesting finding was that there is also a non-linear relationship between digital economy and GTFEE. The effect of digital economy on GTFEE is shown to be first promoted and then inhibited as digital economy level continues to increase. Further, the positive impact of the digital economy on GTFEE is strengthened with increasing levels of economic growth, urbanization, R\&amp;D input, and human capital. Finally, A positive correlation was found between digital economy and GTFEE in the eastern and central regions, but insignificantly in other regions.}

  abstract = {Abstract The advent of the internet and social networks has revolutionised the information space and changed the way in which we communicate and get informed. On the internet, a huge amount of information competes for our (limited) attention. Moreover, despite the increasing quantity of contents, quality may be poor, making the environment particularly florid for misinformation spreading. In such a context, our cognitive biases emerge, first and foremost, confirmation bias, i.e. the human tendency to look for information that is already in agreement with one's system of beliefs. To shade light on the phenomenon, we present a collection of works investigating how information gets consumed and shapes communities on Facebook. We find that confirmation bias plays a crucial role in content selection and diffusion, and we provide empirical evidence of the existence of echo chambers, i.e. well separated and polarised groups of like-minded users sharing a same narrative. Immersed in these bubbles, users keep framing and reinforcing their world view, ignoring information dissenting from their preferred narrative. In this scenario, corrections in the form of fact-checking or debunking attempts seem to fail and have instead a backfire effect. To contrast misinformation, smoothing polarisation is so essential, and may require the design of tailored counter-narratives and appropriate communication strategies, particularly for sensitive topics.},

  abstract = {Italian is a Romance language that has its roots in Vulgar Latin. The birth of the modern Italian started in Tuscany around the 14th century, and it is mainly attributed to the works of Dante Alighieri, Francesco Petrarca and Giovanni Boccaccio, who are among the most acclaimed authors of the medieval age in Tuscany. However, Italy has been characterized by a high variety of dialects, which are often loosely related to each other, due to the past fragmentation of the territory. Italian has absorbed influences from many of these dialects, as also from other languages due to dominion of portions of the country by other nations, such as Spain and France. In this work we present Vulgaris, a project aimed at studying a corpus of Italian textual resources from authors of different regions, ranging in a time period between 1200 and 1600. Each composition is associated to its author, and authors are also grouped in families, i.e. sharing similar stylistic/chronological characteristics. Hence, the dataset is not only a valuable resource for studying the diachronic evolution of Italian and the differences between its dialects, but it is also useful to investigate stylistic aspects between single authors.

  abstract = {Given the fact that there are widely different types of text, it is unlikely that every text is processed in the same way. It is assumed here that for each text type, proficient readers have developed a particular cognitive control system, which regulates the basic operations of text comprehension. The book focuses on the comprehension of literary texts, which involves specific cognitive strategies that enable the reader to respond flexibly to the indeterminacies of the literary reading situation. The study relies heavily on methods and theoretical conceptions from cognitive psychology and presents the results of experiments carried out with real readers. The results are not only relevant to research problems in literary theory, but also to the study of discourse comprehension in general.},

  abstract = {Several factors potentially influence the extent to which readers form a coherent mental representation during story comprehension. The main factors are argument overlap (i.e., connections between text constituents) and situational continuity (i.e., connections between the components of the referential situation model). The authors distinguished 3 dimensions of situational continuity: temporal, spatial, and causal continuity. Results of 2 reading-time studies involving naturalistic stories suggest that readers simultaneously monitor multiple dimensions of the situation model (particularly temporality and causality) under a normal reading instruction. In addition, the construction of a situation model does not critically depend on the presence or absence of argument overlap. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {This article approaches from an empirical perspective the interrelation between foregrounding and complexity in the evaluation of literary texts. For this purpose, a reading experiment is reported. Participants from three cultures (Brazil, Egypt, and the Netherlands) read three texts of different degrees of complexity and evaluated them on a number of variables. Subsequently, they re-read and evaluated the texts once more. The hypothesis was that complex texts would be rated higher on a second than on a first reading; the opposite was predicted for the text with the lowest complexity. Results confirmed this hypothesis for only one group of participants, which raises questions about the nature of a "reading culture."}
