## Bookdown Word Document

This is a simple example of a Bookdown document that can be rendered to a Word document format. You can include text, code chunks, and other elements as needed.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

## Basic formatting

You can use Markdown syntax to format your text. For example, you can create **bold text**, *italic text*, and `inline code`.

You can also create lists:
- Item 1 
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2
  
### Cross-referencing

You can reference sections, figures, and tables. For example, see Figure \@ref(fig:example-figure) for an example figure.

```{r example-figure, fig.cap="An example figure"}
plot(cars)
```

If you want to reference a table, you can do so like this: Table \@ref(tab:example-table).

```{r example-table, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars), caption = "An example table")
```

You can also rerference a Figure that is not embedded inside a chunk, like this: Figure \@ref(fig:example-figure2).

```{r example-figure2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Grumpy cat"}

knitr::include_graphics("../slides/pics/Grumpy_Cat.jpg")

```



Or you can refer to a rmd table like this: Table \@ref(tab:table2).

| **Category** | **Description** | **Subcategory (if any)** |
|:---------|:----------------------|:-----------|
| RURAL | **'rural entities'**: spatial terms relating to -- or characteristic of -- the countryside, in particular related to human settlements or infrastructures, as opposed to those of the city (for example *Wanderweg*: footpath, *Feld*: field, *HÃ¼tte*: hut, shack); |  |
|  | **'natural entities'**: terms describing spatial elements as found in nature, not involving anything made or done by people (for example *Baum*: tree, *Bach*: brook, *Felsen*: rock); |  |
|  | **'rural geolocations (geoloc_rur)'**: proper names of villages and small towns -- with less than 5000 inhabitants -- in Switzerland, Austria, Germany, France and Italy (for example *Zumdorf*, *Enggwil*, *Huttwil*) | village |
|  | **'natural geolocations (geoloc_nat)'**: proper names of natural locations such as mountains, rivers, valley, lakes (for example *Matterhorn*, *Mont Blanc*, *Donau*), | forest, mountain, stream/lake , valley |

Table: (\#tab:table2) Six spatial entities categories grouped under the umbrella terms RURAL and URBAN, and respective sub-categories.


## References

And finally, you can include references in your document. For example, @Woolf1927 for a sample citation, or [@Woolf1927; @Woolf1925] for multiple citations. You can also use the `@` syntax to refer to specific pages, like @Woolf1927[p. 123]. At the end of the document, you can include a bibliography section that will automatically format your references.
