# Alternative Quarto Presentation Template

My favourite presentation template is the one provided by Grant McDermott, which is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean). It is a clean and minimal template that works well for presentations.

You can use it by 

1) navigate to the directory where you want to create your presentation (you can do that in the Files tab in RStudio
2) open a terminal in the chosen directory (again, you can do that in the Files tab in RStudio by clicking on the "More" button --> "Open New Terminal Here")
3) run the following command in the terminal:

```
quarto use template grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean
```

You will be asked if you trust the source, say YES, and whether you would like to create a new folder for the presentation (I normally say yes, and then I give the folder a meaningful name when asked to do so).

Give it a try!
