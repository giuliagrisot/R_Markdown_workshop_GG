## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Images

You can include images in your presentation. For example, here is a logo from the Quarto project:

![grumpy cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Grumpy_Cat_%2814556024763%29_%28cropped%29.jpg/500px-Grumpy_Cat_%2814556024763%29_%28cropped%29.jpg)


## Tables

You can include tables in your presentation. For example, here is a simple table:



## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```


## References

You can include references in your presentation. For example, this is a citation to an article [@Underwood2019], or we can pretend we are referring to another one inline without brackets, for example @Rundquist2016.
